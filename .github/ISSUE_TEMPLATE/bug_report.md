**Patch Submission tips**
Patches should be submitted in the form of Pull Requests to the Ghidra repository on GitHub. But first, consider the following tips to ensure a smooth process when submitting a patch:

 - Ensure that the patch compiles and does not break any build-time tests.
 - Be understanding, patient, and friendly; developers may need time to review your submissions before they can take action or respond. This does not mean your contribution is not valued. If your contribution has not received a response in a reasonable time, consider commenting with a polite inquiry for an update.
 - Limit your patches to the smallest reasonable change to achieve your intended goal. For example, do not make unnecessary indentation changes; but don't go out of your way to make the patch so minimal that it isn't easy to read, either. Consider the reviewer's perspective.
 - Before submission, please squash your commits to using a message that starts with the issue number and a description of the changes.
 - Isolate multiple patches from each other. If you wish to make several independent patches, do so in separate, smaller pull requests that can be reviewed more easily.
 - Be prepared to answer questions from reviewers. They may have further questions before accepting your patch, and may even propose changes. Please accept this feedback constructively, and not as a rejection of your proposed change.

 - OS: [e.g. macOS 10.14.2]
