 * PrepDev - task to prepare a development environment for Ghidra.  It needs to be run
 * 			 whenever the Ghidra git repos are first cloned or after a 'clean'.  It also
 *           needs to be run after a change to the sleigh ANTLR grammar files.
 *
 * 	1) Creates the help directories in the build directory.  These directories are 
 *     included in the eclipse project files and must exist for eclipse to be able to compile
 *     Ghidra
 *
 *	2) Builds the sleigh ANTLR code and compiles it into the 'classes' directory. Also builds
 *     a src-zip of the generated java code.  NOTE: this is accomplished by adding the
 *     following dependency in the processorUtils.gradle file: "prepDev.dependsOn(sleighCompile)"
 *     We can't do that dependency here because not all projects have a sleighCompile task.
