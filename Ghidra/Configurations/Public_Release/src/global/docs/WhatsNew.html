	<H1>Ghidra: NSA Reverse Engineering Software</H2>
    
    <P>
    Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by NSA's Research Directorate.
    This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable
    users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
    Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with
    hundreds of other features.  Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and 
    executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes.  Users may also
    develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using the exposed API.  In addition there are
    numerous ways to extend Ghidra such as new processors, loaders/exporters, automated analyzers,
    and new visualizations.
    </P>
    
    <P>
    In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems
    on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform.  NSA
    has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious
    code and generating deep insights for NSA analysts who seek a better understanding of potential
    vulnerabilities in networks and systems.
    </P>
    
    <H1>What's new in Ghidra 10.1 BETA</H1>
    
    <H2>The not-so-fine print: Please Read!</H2>
    
	<P>Ghidra 10.1 is fully backward compatible with project data from previous releases. However, programs and data type archives
	which are created or modified in 10.1 will not be useable by an earlier Ghidra version.</P>

	<P>This release includes many new features and capabilities, performance improvements, quite a few bug fixes, and many pull-request
	contributions.  Thanks to all those who have contributed their time, thoughts, and code. The Ghidra user community
	thanks you too!</P>

	<P>NOTE: Ghidra Server: The Ghidra 10.1 server is compatible with Ghidra 9.2 and later Ghidra clients.  Ghidra 10.1 
	clients are compatible with all 9.x servers.</P>
	
	<H2>Distribution</H2>
	
	<P> The Ghidra distribution has been enhanced to allow building of native executables directly from a release distribution.
	The distribution currently provides Linux 64-bit, Windows 64-bit, and MacOS x86 binaries.  If you have another platform,
	for example a MacOS M1 based system or a Linux variant, the support/buildNatives script can build the decompiler,
	demangler, and legacy PDB executables for your plaform.  You will need gradle that supports building for your platform
	and a working compiler for your environment.  Not every platform can be supported, as a pre-requisite is
	support by gradle.  Ghidra has been tested to build additional native executables for Linux ARM 64-bit,
	Linux x86 variants, and macOS ARM 64-bit.  </P>
	
	<P>Please see the "Building Ghidra Native Components" section of the Installation Guide for additional information.</P>
	
	<H2>Debugger</H2>
	
	<H3>Pure Emulation</H3>
    <P>There's a new action <B>Emulate Program</B> (next to the <B>Debug Program</B> button) to launch the current program in Ghidra's p-code emulator.
    This is not a new "connector." Rather, it starts a blank trace with the current program mapped in. The user can then step using the usual
    "Emulate Step" actions in the "Threads" window. In general, this is sufficient to run simple experiments or step through local regions of code.
    To modify emulated machine state, use the "Watches" window. At the moment, no other provider can modify emulated machine state.</P>

    <P>This is also very useful in combination with the "P-code Stepper" window (this plugin must be added manually via File->Configure).
    A language developer can, for example, assemble an instruction that needs testing, start emulating with the cursor at that instruction,
    and then step individual p-code ops in the "P-code Stepper" window.</P>

    <H3>Raw Hex for Live Memory</H3>
    <P>We've added a variant of the "Bytes" window within dynamic trace, allowing viewing live memory as hex, ascii, etc. The window
    includes the same background coloring, navigation, and tracking actions as the "Dynamic Listing". To open this window, select Window -> Bytes -> Memory.</P>
	
	<H3>LLDB Support</H3>
	<P>Working toward debugging macOS targets, we've added support for LLDB. Currently, some effort is required on the user's end to clone, patch,
	and build LLDB with language bindings for Java. Once done, the new connectors for LLDB can be used in the normal fashion. While intended for macOS,
	these connectors also work on Linux, and may work on Windows, too. This offers an alternative for those who prefer lldb to gdb.</P>
	
	<H2>Data Types</H2>
	
	<P>Support for zero-length data types and components has been improved, although such types will continue to
	report a non-zero length using the <i>DataType.getLength()</i> method.  For code/features that can support zero-length data types the <i>DataType.isZeroLength()</i> 
	method must be used to identify this case.  The <i>DataType.isZeroLength()</i> is no longer synonymous with <i>DataType.isNotYetDefined()</i> which is 
	intended to identify data types (i.e., structures and unions) whose components have not yet be specified.  Along these same lines, Ghidra
	now allows zero-element arrays to be defined.  The API methods supporting a trailing flex-array on structures have been removed in favor
	of using zero-element array components.  Existing flex-array instances will be upgraded accordinagly within Programs and Data Type Archives.
	The static method <i>DataTypeComponent.usesZeroLengthComponent(DataType)</i> may be used to determine if a zero-length component
	will be used for a specific data type.  Due to the overlapping behavior of zero-length components, a data type which returns <i>true</i>
	 for <i>isNotYetDefined()</i> will not produce a zero-length component.</P>
	
	<H2>Mach-O Binary Import</H2>
	<P>Mach-O binary import has been greatly improved, including handling of relocation pointer chains, support for newer Objective-C
	class structures with RelativePointers, many additional load commands such as encrypted blocks, and more recent dyld and kernel caches.</P>
	
	<H2>Android</H2>
	<P>Added support for Android formats (ART, OAT, ODEX, DEX, CDEX, VDEX) and Dalvik VM Sleigh modules for each major Android release up to version 12.x.
	Support for the latest android release is in progress for a future release.</P>

	<H2>Performance Improvements</H2>
	<P>There have been many performance improvements to import, analysis, program data base access, many API calls, and the user interface.</P>
	<P>Symbol performance in Ghidra was significantly improved. Specifically, new database indexes were created to improve finding primary
	symbols as well as improving lookups by combinations of name, namespace, and address.</P>
	
	<H2>Processors</H2>
	<P>Improvements and bug fixes to many processors to include: X86, ARM, AARCH64, SPARC, PPC, SH4, RISC-V, and 6502.</P>
	
	<H2>DWARF</H2>
	<P>Support for loading DWARF debug information from a separate file during import has been added.  In addition data type information contained in the
	separate debug file can be loaded without application to a program, enabling the use of debug information from a related version of the binary.</P>

	<P>
	... WORK IN PROGRESS ... See release notes for more details.
	</P>
	
    <H2>Bug Fixes and Enhancements</H2>
    <P> Numerous other bug fixes and improvements are fully listed in the <a href="ChangeHistory.html">ChangeHistory</a> file.</P>
