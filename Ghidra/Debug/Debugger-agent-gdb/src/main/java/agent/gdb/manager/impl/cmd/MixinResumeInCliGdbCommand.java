 * <p>
 * I'm not sure if it's a bug in GDB or Linux, or what, but if I attach to a target that doesn't
 * have a tty then resume (i.e., continue or step) from the mi2 interpreter, it seems I cannot use
 * "interrupt" from the primary (console) interpreter. So, for these resumes, I need to issue the
 * command from the console, allowing ^C to work.
