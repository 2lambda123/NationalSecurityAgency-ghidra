/**
 * A recorder from target object, usually a process, to a destination trace
 * 
 * <p>
 * The recorder is the glue from a portion of a debugger's model into a Ghidra trace. As such, this
 * object maintains a mapping between corresponding objects of interest in the model tree to the
 * trace, and that mapping can be queried. In most cases, UI components which deal with tracing need
 * only read the trace in order to populate their display.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The recorder copies information in one direction; thus, if a trace UI component needs to affect
 * the target, it must do so via the debugger's model. Such components should use the
 * {@code getTarget*} methods in order to find the target object for a given trace object. The
 * effects of calls on recorded target objects are recorded into the trace automatically. Thus, it
 * is not necessary for trace UI components to react to the successful completion of such calls, so
 * long as they're listening for changes to the trace. However, they MUST react to the exceptional
 * completion of such calls, most likely displaying an error dialog.
