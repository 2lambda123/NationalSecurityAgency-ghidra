    <H1>Debugger: Troubleshooting</H1>

    <P>Often, it's a good idea to troubleshoot starting with your platform's native debugger. If it
    doesn't work there, it's not likely to work in Ghidra, since it relies on that debugger. For
    Linux, this is GDB; for Windows, this is WinDbg.</P>

    <H2>Error Console</H2>

    <P>The first place to look when you're having trouble is the Debug Console. Second, if you're
    running from Eclipse, you can check its "Console" window. Often, Ghidra's Debug Console will
    offer actions to help you resolve a well-known issue or configuration problem. It also
    duplicates the error log when those messages are emitted from a debugger-related component.
    These typically offer clues to exactly what has gone wrong.</P>

    <H2>Settings and Toggles</H2>

    <P>This list is not exhaustive, but here are some options to examine if you're having trouble.
    In the FrontEnd tool, under <SPAN class="menu">Edit &rarr; Tool Options</SPAN>, select
    "Debugger.Workflow."</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>"Map modules..." and "Map sections..." control how the debugger attempts to map static
      and dynamic memory.</LI>

      <LI>"Disassemble..." triggers automatic disassembly in the dynamic view.</LI>

      <LI>"Show debugger interpreter..." automatically provides access to the command line.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Dynamic Listing:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>"Sync to Static Listing" controls the tracking of the Static listing.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Objects provider:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>"Record Automatically" causes a trace to be started when a Process object comes into
      view. If the process object is not exposed automatically, you may have to expand the tree to
      trigger the trace. If auto-record is toggled off, you'll need to hit "Record (R)" with the
      process selected to start a trace.</LI>

      <LI>"Subscribe to..." causes a particular object to be tracked by the trace. Processes,
      threads, registers, memory, stack, and so forth are tracked automatically, but you may wish
      to add other objects ad hoc.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Threads provider:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>The "Track the tool to the latest snap" toggle determines whether the caret (and all
      resulting information) should track the current thread position as it updates.</LI>

      <LI>The "Synchronize trace activation..." toggle attempts to maintain synchronization between
      the Object provider (i.e. the active target information) and the trace.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Debugger menu:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>The "Save Traces By Default" toggle causes traces to be saved into the Ghidra project
      database at the end of a session. (Open sessions will be re-opened with the tool in the
      Threads window, reflected in the thin tabs at its top.)</LI>
    </UL>

    <H1><A name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions / Common Problems</A></H1>

    <H2><A name="no_executable">I Can't Launch the Current Program</A></H2>

    <P>This happens when the local launchers cannot locate the original executable from which the
    current program was imported. Furthermore, if the user account under which Ghidra is running
    does not have permission to execute the original executable, the local launchers will not make
    offers to execute it. First, use <SPAN class="menu">Help &rarr; About [program]</SPAN> to check
    the path of the executable. If it was imported from an older version of Ghidra, it may not be
    correctly recorded. Verify that the file exists on the local system and can be executed. You
    may need to close and re-open the program database or just switch program tabs back and forth
    to get the launchers to re-assess their offers.</P>

    <H2><A name="gdb_mising">I Can't Launch With GDB</A></H2>

    <P>Ghidra does not come packaged with any 3rd-party debuggers. It relies on what is already
    available on the local system. If you're trying to debug on Linux, and you only see the "GDB
    over SSH" launcher, it's likely because the local launchers could not find your copy of GDB.
    Either you don't have one installed, or it's not in its usual place. First verify GDB is
    installed and that you can run it from your shell's command line. We recommend version 8 or
    better. Second, click the "Connect" button in the "Targets" window, select the desired GDB
    connector and configure GDB's path appropriately. Then, click "Connect" and verify the
    connection is created successfully. You should now be able to use the "Quick Launch" button in
    the "Objects" window to launch the current program. Furthermore, the now-configured connector
    should make offers in the "Debug Program" menu and the "Debug" drop-down button.</P>

    <P>If you're trying to debug using GDB on Windows, please consider using WinDbg (dbgeng.dll)
    instead. If you insist on GDB, then there is a workaround, but it may take some work. We have
    not yet implemented a pseudo-terminal wrapper for Windows, which is needed to communicate with
    GDB/MI and support interrupts. The work-around is to use the "GDB over SSH" connector, but
    you'll need to install an SSH server for Windows. There are a variety of options, including
    WSL, Cygwin, and MSYS.</P>

    <H2><A name="ssh_key_exchange">I Can't Connect to GDB Over SSH</A></H2>

    <P>First, verify that you can SSH into the target system and execute GDB via your shell's
    command line. If that works, but Ghidra still can't connect, then it's likely an issue with
    allowed / supported key exchange algorithms. Ghidra currently uses Ganymed SSH v262, which
    (unfortunately) supports very few (likely outdated) algorithms, and those algorithms are
    removed from the default SSH configuration of more recent Linux distributions. One solution is
    to replace the Ganymed JAR file with a patched one. There is a "v263," which supports more
    algorithms, but it is not available in Maven Central, and is not created by Ganymed's original
    maintainers. A second solution is to change the target system's SSH configuration to allow the
    older algorithms. At some point, we may convert our connector to use JSch instead, since it's
    actively maintained.</P>

    <H2><A name="breakpoints_ineffective">My Breakpoints Aren't Working</A></H2>

    <P>If your target is not breaking as expected, chances are the breakpoint has not actually been
    sent to the debugger. Breakpoints in the static listing are not necessarily effective for a
    target. Many things depend on tracing and module mapping to work correctly. Occasionally,
    either because of configuration options, or some other hiccup, these dependencies are not met.
    Furthermore, Ghidra can only send breakpoints to a target while it is suspended. If you are
    trying, for example, to break before "main", you must ensure Ghidra has a chance to place the
    breakpoint before the target would reach it. This may require using the command interpreter or
    changing your native debugger's options. Otherwise, verify that you are actually tracing the
    target where you expected a breakpoint to appear. Then, verify that the module containing your
    breakpoint has been mapped into the trace.</P>

    <H2>My Target is not Being Traced</H2>

    <P>If the dynamic listing is empty, chances are, you are not recording your target. If that is
    the case, right-click your target in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects</A> window and select
    "Record". Please note that this action is enabled on any object, but is ignored if nothing
    knows how to record it. Recorders typically examine the object and its environment (i.e.,
    debugger name, target operating system, architecture) to determine if and how to record it. Be
    sure you have selected the process, not a thread.</P>

    <H2>I Click Record, but I Get an Empty Dialog</H2>

    <P>That dialog is meant to display a list of offers for recording the selected target. If it's
    empty, it's because nothing knows how to record it. Most likely, this means the target
    environment (arch, os, etc.) is not recognized. Rarely, this is an error in the connector,
    which may incorrectly report the target environment. Less rarely, the native debugger requires
    the user to manually specify the target platform. Most likely, the target environment is simply
    not supported by Ghidra, yet. If Ghidra supports the target processor, this can usually be
    resolved by coding up a new opinion, selecting the correct Ghidra language and compiler spec
    (ABI) for the environment as reported by the debugger connection.</P>

    <H2>My Modules are not Mapped in</H2>

    <P>If changing your cursor location in the static listing does not automatically synchronize
    the dynamic listing to the same place, and vice versa, chances are the module is not mapped.
    (It is also possible you disabled this sync feature, but that is not usually the case.) You can
    also check the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window to see if the memory ranges are mapped properly. To attempt to map the module, use the
    <A href="help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html">Modules</A> window.
    Right-click the module where you expected to sync and select "Map Modules." If you do not see
    the program you expected, it may be because it is not named in a way that Ghidra would
    recognize it as the given module. To force Ghidra to map a module to the current program,
    select "Map Module to ...."</P>
