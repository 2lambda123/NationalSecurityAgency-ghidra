    <H1>Debugger: Troubleshooting</H1>

    <H2>Error Console</H2>

    <P>The first place to look when you're having trouble is the Debug Console. Second, if you're
    in Eclipse, you can check its "Console" window. Often, Ghidra's Debug Console will offer
    actions to help you resolve a well-known issue or configuration problem. It also duplicates the
    error log, when those messages are emitted from a debugger-related class. These typically offer
    clues to exactly what has gone wrong.</P>

    <H2>Settings and Toggles</H2>

    <P>This list is not exhaustive, but here are some options to examine if you're having trouble.
    In the FrontEnd tool, under <SPAN class="menu">Edit &rarr; Tool Options</SPAN>, select
    "Debugger.Workflow."</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>"Map modules..." and "Map sections..." control how the debugger attempts to map static
      and dynamic memory.</LI>

      <LI>"Disassemble..." triggers automatic disassembly in the dynamic view.</LI>

      <LI>"Show debugger interpreter..." automatically provides access to the command line.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Dynamic Listing:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>"Sync to Static Listing" controls the tracking of the Static listing.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Objects provider:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>"Record Automatically" causes a trace to be started when a Process object comes into
      view. If the process object is not exposed automatically, you may have to expand the tree to
      trigger the trace. If auto-record is toggled off, you'll need to hit "Record (R)" with the
      process selected to start a trace.</LI>

      <LI>"Subscribe to..." causes a particular obejct to be tracked by the trace. Processes,
      threads, registers, memory, stack, and so forth are tracked automatically, but you may wish
      to add other objects ad hoc.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the Threads provider:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>The "Track...to latest snap" toggle determines whether the caret (and all resulting
      information) should track the current thread position as it updates.</LI>

      <LI>The "Set to automatically save..." toggle causes traces to be saved into the Ghidra
      program database at the end of a session. (Open sessions will be re-opened with the tool in
      the Threads window, reflected in the thin tabs at its top.)</LI>

      <LI>The "Synchronize..." toggle attempts to maintain synchronization between the Object
      provider (i.e. the active target information) and the trace.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2><A name="breakpoints_ineffective">My Breakpoints Aren't Working</A></H2>

    <P>If your target is not breaking as expected, chances are the breakpoint has not actually been
    sent to the debugger. Breakpoints in the static listing are not necessarily effective for a
    target. Many things depend on tracing and module mapping to work correctly. Occasionally,
    either because of configuration options, or some other hiccup, these dependencies are not met.
    Futhermore, Ghidra can only send breakpoints to a target while it is suspended. If you are
    trying, for example, to break before "main", you must ensure Ghidra has a chance to place the
    breakpoint before the target would reach it. This may require using the command interpreter or
    changing your native debugger's options. Otherwise, verify that you are actually tracing the
    target where you expected a breakpoint to appear. Then, verify that the module containing your
    breakpoint has been mapped into the trace.</P>

    <H2>My Target is not Being Traced</H2>

    <P>If the dynamic listing is empty, chances are, you are not recording your target. If that is
    the case, right-click your target in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects</A> window and select
    "Record". Please note that this action is enabled on any object, but is ignored if nothing
    knows how to record it. Currently, only user-mode processes running on a 64-bit x86 system are
    known to work well. Be sure you have selected the process, not a thread.</P>

    <H2>My Modules are not Mapped in</H2>

    <P>If changing your cursor location in the static listing does not automatically synchronize
    the dynamic listing to the same place, and vice versa, chances are the module is not mapped.
    (It is also possible you disabled this sync feature, but that is not usually the case.) You can
    also check the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window to see if the memory ranges are mapped properly. To attempt to map the module, use the
    <A href="help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html">Modules</A> window.
    Right-click the module where you expected to sync and select "Map Modules." If you do not see
    the program you expected, it may be because it is not named in a way that Ghidra would
    recognize it as the given module. Currently, the program's name must contain (case insensitive)
    the module's filename (ignoring the full path). A user action to remedy this is a known feature
    gap.</P>
