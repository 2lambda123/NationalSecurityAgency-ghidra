    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>Watches refer to expressions which are evaluated each pause in order to monitor the value of
    variables in the target machine state. The watch variables are expressed in Sleigh and
    evaluated in the current thread's and trace's context at the current point in time. If the
    current trace is live and at the present, then the target state is read and recorded as
    necessary. The watch can be assigned a data type so that the raw data is rendered in a
    meaningful way. When applicable, that data type can optionally be applied to the trace
    database. Some metadata about the watch is also given, e.g., the address of the value.</P>

    <H2>Examples</H2>

    <P>For those less familar with Sleigh, here are some example expressions:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><CODE>*:4 (RSP+8)</CODE>: Display 4 bytes of [ram] starting 8 bytes after the offset
      given by register RSP.</LI>

      <LI><CODE>*:4 0x7fff0004:8</CODE>: Display 4 bytes starting at ram:7fff0004. The extraneous,
      but required, size specifier on constant derefs is a known issue. Just use the target's
      pointer size in bytes.</LI>

      <LI><CODE>*:8 RSP</CODE>: Display 8 bytes of [ram] starting at the offset given by register
      RSP.</LI>

      <LI><CODE>RSP</CODE>: Display the value of register RSP.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table displays and allows modification of each watch. It has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Expression - the user-modifiable Sleigh expression defining this watch.</LI>

      <LI>Address - when evaluation succeeds, the address of the watch's value. This field is
      really only meaningful when the outermost operator of the expression is a memory dereference.
      Double-clicking a row will navigate the primary dynamic listing to this address, if
      possible.</LI>

      <LI>Value - the raw bytes of the watched buffer. If the expression is a register, then this
      is its hexadecimal value. If the value has changed since the last navigation event, this cell
      is rendered in <FONT color="red">red</FONT>.</LI>

      <LI>Type - the user-modifiable type of the watch. Note the type is not marked up in the
      trace. Clicking the Apply Data Type action will apply it to the current trace, if
      possible.</LI>

      <LI>Representation - the value of the watch as interpreted the selected data type.</LI>

      <LI>Error - if an error occurs during compilation or evaluation of the expression, that error
      is rendered here. Double-clicking the row will display the stack trace. Note that errors
      during evaluation can be a very common occurrence, especially as contexts change, and should
      not cause alarm. An expression devised for one context may not have meaning under another,
      even if it evaluates without error. E.g., <CODE>RIP</CODE> will disappear when switching to a
      32-bit trace, or <CODE>*:8 (*:8 (RSP+8))</CODE> may cause an invalid dereference if an x86
      <CODE>PUSH</CODE> causes <CODE>*:8 (RSP+8)</CODE> to become 0.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The watches window provides the following actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="apply_data_type"></A>Apply Data to Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there's an active trace and at least one watch with an address
    and data type is selected. If so, it applies that data type to the value in the listing. That
    is, it attempts to apply the selected data type to the evaluated address, sizing it to the
    value's size.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_addresses"></A>Select Range</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there's an active trace and at least one watch with memory
    addresses is selected. It selects the memory range comprising the resulting value. This only
    works when the outermost operator of the expression is a memory dereference. It selects the
    range at the address of that dereference having the size of the dereference. For example, the
    expression <CODE>*:8 RSP</CODE> would cause 8 bytes of memory, starting at the offset given by
    RSP, to be selected in the dynamic listing.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_reads"></A>Select Reads</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there's an active trace and at least one watch with memory
    reads is selected. It selects all memory ranges dereferenced in the course of expression
    evaluation. This can be useful when examining a watch whose value seems unusual. For example,
    the expression <CODE>*:8 RSP</CODE> would cause 8 bytes of memory, starting at the offset given
    by RSP, to be selected in the dynamic listing -- the same result as Select Range. However, the
    expression <CODE>*:4 (*:8 RSP)</CODE> would cause two ranges to be selected: 8 bytes starting
    at RSP and 4 bytes starting at the offset given by <CODE>*:8 RSP</CODE>.</P>

    <H3><A name="add"></A>Add</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It adds a blank watch to the table.</P>

    <H3><A name="remove"></A>Remove</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one watch is selected. It removes those watches.</P>

    <H2><A name="colors"></A>Tool Options: Colors</H2>

    <P>The watch window uses colors to hint about changes in and freshness of displayed values.
    They can be configured in the tool's options. By default, changed values are displayed in red,
    and stale values are displayed in dark grey. A "stale" value is one which depends on any
    register or memory whose contents are not known. The value displayed is that computed from the
    last recorded contents, defaulting to 0 when never recorded. Simply, a "changed" watch is one
    whose value has just changed. For example, if a value changes as result of stepping, then that
    watch is changed. However, given the possibility of rewinding, changing thread focus, etc.,
    "changed" is actually subtly more flexible. The watch remembers the evaluation from the user's
    last coordinates (time, thread, frame, etc.) as well as the current coordinates. So, "changed"
    more precisely refers to a watch whose value differs between those two coordinates. This
    permits the user to switch focus between different coordinates and quickly identify what is
    different.</P>
