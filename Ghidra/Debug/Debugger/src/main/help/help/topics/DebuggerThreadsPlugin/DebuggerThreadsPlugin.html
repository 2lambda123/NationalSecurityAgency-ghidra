    <P>In general, a thread refers to a unit of concurrent execution within a target. Typically,
    each thread carries its own execution context, so this window provides a means of navigating
    those contexts. Furthermore, this window provides a means of navigating and managing open
    traces, much like the static listing provides a means of navigating open programs. The window
    also provides a timeline showing thread lifespans, and displays a caret which can be used to
    navigate the current point in time. This window, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStackPlugin/DebuggerStackPlugin.html">Stack</A> window, and the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Dynamic Listing</A> window
    provide a complete trace navigation system.</P>

    <H2>Trace Tabs</H2>

    <P>The trace tab bar is displayed when at least one trace is open. It displays the name of each
    open trace in a button, where the "current" or "focused" trace is selected. Clicking a tab will
    select its trace and focus the tool onto it. A trace associated with a live target has a red
    "recording" icon at its left. If that icon is not present, or has disappeared, the trace is
    dead or terminated. A "dead" trace can still be manipulated and marked up, but it will
    (obviously) not record any new information from the (dead) target.</P>

    <P>In most cases, a trace is ephemeral, but occasionally, interesting behavior is observed that
    is difficult to store as program mark-up. When a trace is no longer needed, it can be closed by
    right-clicking the tab and selecting "Close Trace." <FONT color="red">Warning:</FONT> closing a
    trace that has not been saved <EM>cannot</EM> be undone. If you have gathered a collection of
    unwanted traces, use the "Close Others," "Close Dead," or "Close All" action from the pop-up
    menu.</P>

    <H2>Navigating Threads</H2>

    <P>Selecting a thread in the timeline or the table will navigate to (or "activate" or "focus")
    that thread. Many windows which are sensitive to the current thread will update. Notably, the
    <A href="help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A> window
    will display the new thread's register values. <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Listing</A> windows with
    configured location tracking will re-compute that location with the new thread's context and
    navigate to it. The thread timeline displays all recorded threads in a timeline. Threads which
    are alive will appear to extend "to the end of time." The threads table displays more detailed
    information, in the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Name - the name of the thread given by the debugger. Often, this is just an index or
      unique id assigned to the thread. This field can be modified, and it has no effect on the
      target.</LI>

      <LI>Created - the point in time when this thread was first observed. If the thread's creation
      was observed, then it is its creation time.</LI>

      <LI>Destroyed - if destroyed, the point in time when this thread was last observed. If the
      thread's destruction was observed, then it is its destruction time.</LI>

      <LI>State - the thread's current state. For a dead trace, this is either ALIVE or TERMINATED,
      and depends solely on whether or not a destruction time was recorded. For a live trace, this
      may also take RUNNING, STOPPED, or UNKNOWN, depending on what is reported by the debugger.
      The state always reflects the present, or latest known, state.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - a user-modifiable comment about the thread.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Navigating Time</H2>

    <P>The user can navigate through time within the current trace by using the caret above the
    threads timeline. There are also actions for "stepping the trace" forward and backward. See the
    <A href="help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time</A> window for a way to
    display and navigate to specific events in the trace's timeline.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_snap_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow_up.png">Step Track
    Snap Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a snapshot previous to the current. It steps the
    trace backward to the previous snapshot, causing most windows to display the recorded data from
    the new point in time. Note that stepping backward does not affect the target, and many windows
    that would ordinarily interact with a live target, may no longer do so, until the user steps
    back to the present. Note also that any component or script that does interact with the target
    and record things "into the present" will not cause updates in windows that are not displaying
    the present.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_snap_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow_down.png">Step Trace
    Snap Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a snapshot ahead of the current. It steps the
    trace forward to the next snapshot, causing most windows to display the recorded data from the
    new point in time. If the new point in time represents "the present" for a live trace, then
    many windows will resume interacting with the target. Note that stepping the trace does not
    affect the target; however, stepping back to the present may cause some windows to query the
    target.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_tick_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepback.png">Step Track
    Tick Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a point in time previous to the current. It steps
    the trace backward to the previous tick, possibly using emulation. Note that stepping backward
    does not affect the target, and many windows that would ordinarily interact with a live target,
    may no longer do so, until the user steps back to the present. Note also that any component or
    script that does interact with the target and record things "into the present" may not cause
    updates in windows that are not displaying the present.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_tick_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png">Step Trace Tick
    Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a thread is selected. It steps the current thread forward to
    the next tick, using emulation. Note that emulation does not affect the target, and many
    windows that would ordinarily interact with a live target, may no longer do so, until the user
    steps back to the present. Note also that any component or script that does interact with the
    target and record things "into the present" may not cause updates in windows that are not
    displaying the present.</P>

    <H3><A name="seek_trace_present"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/continue.png">Seek Trace to
    Present</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available and is enabled by default. When first enabled, if the
    current trace is live, it immediately steps the trace to the present. Furthermore, as long as
    it is enabled and the current trace is live, whenever the recorder steps forward, the tool
    steps with it. In most cases, this option should remain on, otherwise stepping the target will
    not cause any windows to update to the new machine state. Toggling it off then on is a quick
    way to return to the present after browsing the past.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>There are additional actions for managing focus and traces.</P>

    <H3><A name="sync_focus"></A>Synchronize Trace and Target Focus</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available and is enabled by default. While enabled, any changes in
    navigation coordinates are translated, to the extent possible, and sent to the connected
    debugger. This may, for example, issue <CODE>thread</CODE> and/or <CODE>frame</CODE> commands
    to GDB so that commands typed into its CLI will refer to the same thread and frame as is
    focused in Ghidra. Conversely, any debugger events which indicate a change in focus are
    translated, to the extent possible, into navigation coordinates and activated in Ghidra. For
    example, if the user issues a <CODE>frame</CODE> command to the CLI of a GDB connection, then
    Ghidra will navigate to that same frame.</P>
