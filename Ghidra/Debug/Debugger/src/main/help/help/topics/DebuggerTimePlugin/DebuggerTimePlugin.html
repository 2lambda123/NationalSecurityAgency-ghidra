    </TABLE>

    <P>This window displays all recorded "snapshots" in the current trace. Typically, there is one
    snapshot per event recorded. Other tables often display the times of various events or use time
    ranges to describe lifespans of various records. Those times refer to the "snap," which is a
    0-up counter of snapshot records. Thus, a snapshot is a collection of observations of a
    target's state, usually while suspended, along with any user mark up. Selecting a snapshot
    navigates to the selected point in time. Note that browsing the past may prevent other windows
    from interacting with a live target.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Snap - the 0-up index of the snapshot (event) recorded.</LI>

      <LI>Timestamp - the "wall-clock" time of the event. If the debugger doesn't give an event
      time, or the snapshot does not correspond to an event, then it is the snapshot creation
      time.</LI>

      <LI>Event Thread - the thread that caused the event, if applicable. In the case of thread
      creation, this should probably be the spawned thread, not the parent.</LI>

      <LI>Ticks - the number of ticks until the next snapshot, if known. If not known, or if
      nothing cared to record or compute this, it is 0.</LI>

      <LI>Description - a user-modifiable description of the snapshot or event. This defaults to
      the debugger's description of the event.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The time window provides the following action:</P>

    <H3><A name="hide_scratch"></A>Hide Scratch</H3>

    <P>This toggle action is always available. It is enabled by default. The emulation service,
    which enabled trace extrapolation and interpolation, writes emulated state into the trace's
    "scratch space," which comprises all negative snaps. When this toggle is enabled, those
    snapshots are hidden. They can be displayed by disabling this toggle. Note that navigating into
    scratch space may cause temporary undefined behavior in some windows, and may prevent
    interaction with the target.</P>
