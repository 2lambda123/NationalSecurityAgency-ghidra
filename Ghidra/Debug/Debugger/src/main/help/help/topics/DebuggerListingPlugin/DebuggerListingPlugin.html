    <P><A name="Toggle_Header"></A>The dynamic listing is analogous to Ghidra's listing for static
    analysis, but in the dynamic context. That is, it displays memory contents from a target. More
    precisely, it displays recorded memory contents in a trace. In most use cases, that trace is
    "at the present", meaning it is the most recent memory from a live target. Multiple listings
    can be displayed simultaneously, using the same pattern as many other Ghidra windows. The
    "primary" listing is always displayed and generally tracks with the rest of the tool. Any
    listing can be "snapshotted", i.e., duplicated. This is where dynamic listings differ from
    static listings. Static snapshots remain in place; they do not automatically navigate. Dynamic
    snapshots can still be configured to navigate, following the rest of the tool. A common use is
    to configure a "snapshot" to follow the stack pointer. Still, you can disable a listing's
    automatic navigation, so it behaves like a true snapshot. A current limitation is that you
    cannot use snapshots to display different points in time for the same trace.</P>

    <P>Where applicable, the static listing's location is synchronized to the dynamic listing, and
    vice versa. The dynamic listing permits most of the same mark-up as the static listing. Any
    mark-up added to the dynamic listing is saved to the trace. All mark-up (and nearly all trace
    record types, for that matter) have a location in space and time. That is, they occupy an
    address range (like mark-up in Ghidra programs), but also a time range (unique to traces). When
    mark-up is added to the listing, it exists "from this time on". That is, its time interval is
    from the current time to infinity, i.e., it has been created but never destroyed. When mark-up
    is removed from the listing, its "destruction time" is set to just before the current time. If
    this would cause the mark-up to "never exist", i.e., its destruction time is equal to its
    creation time, then the record is deleted altogether. This yields a mostly-intuitive mechanism
    for marking things up "in time," but the fact that mark-up is bound in time can still be
    surprising. For example, disassembling some instructions and then stepping back in time will
    cause that disassembly to disappear.</P>

    <P>Because not all memory is captured, some background coloring is used to indicate the state
    of attempted memory reads. Regardless of state, the most-recent contents, as recorded in the
    trace, or 0s are displayed in the listing. "Stale" memory, that is ranges of memory which have
    not been read at the current time, are displayed with a darker background. Where that memory is
    marked "read-only" and has been successfully read previously, that coloring is subdued, since
    the contents are unlikely to have changed. Where a read was attempted but failed, the range is
    displayed with a pink background. Otherwise, up-to-date contents are displayed with the default
    background color.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The listing provides a variety of actions, some for managing and configuring listings, and
    others for capturing memory from a target.</P>

    <H3><A name="new_listing"></A>New Dynamic Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is always available in the <SPAN class="menu">Window &rarr; Debugger</SPAN>
    menu. It creates a new listing window with the same configuration as the primary dynamic
    listing. It is equivalent to "snapshotting" the primary dynamic listing.</P>

    <H3><A name="export_view"></A>Export Trace View</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever there is a trace open in the listing. It is analogous to
    "Export Program," but for the current trace at the current time. This provides a mechanism for
    capturing a particular point in time from a trace as a static image. The exported image can be
    analyzed in Ghidra or another tool.</P>

    <H3><A name="follows_thread"></A>Follows Selected Thread</H3>

    <P>This action is only available on snapshot dynamic listings. The primary listing always
    follows the tool's current thread. Disabling this toggle causes the snapshot to remain on its
    own current thread rather than following the tool's. The current thread is used when computing
    a location to navigate to automatically. It is only applicable when "Track Location" is set to
    something other than "Do Not Track."</P>

    <H3><A name="track_location"></A>Track Location</H3>

    <P>This action is always available on all dynamic listings. It configures automatic navigation
    for the dynamic listing. When location tracking is enabled, the listing is automatically
    navigated to an address computed from the trace's or target's machine state. The address (and
    its corresponding static address) are also highlighted in green. The computed address is
    affected by the tool's current "coordinates," that is the selected thread, frame, and point in
    time. The options are pluggable, but currently consist of:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Do Not Track - disables automatic navigation.</LI>

      <LI>Track Program Counter - (default) navigates this listing to the current program counter.
      If the stack contains a record of the program counter, it is preferred to the recorded
      register value. Note that debuggers may vary in how they report the program counter, and its
      meaning may vary among platforms. While there may be some nuances to the register value, the
      value recorded in the stack should indicate the next instruction to be executed.</LI>

      <LI>Track Stack Pointer - navigates this listing to the current stack pointer. Again,
      platforms may vary in how they define the stack pointer.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3><A name="go_to"></A>Go To (G)</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a trace is active in the listing. It prompts the user for
    an address, which can be expressed in Sleigh, then attempts to navigate to it. The expression
    is evaluated in the context of the current thread and point in time. If the current trace is
    live and at the present, the target may be queried to retrieve any machine state required to
    evaluate the expression.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src="images/DebuggerGoToDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <H3><A name="sync_static"></A>Sync to Static Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is always available, but only on the primary dynamic listing. It configures
    location synchronization with the (primary) static listing. When enabled, navigation in either
    listing &mdash; including automatic navigation &mdash; automatically navigates to the
    corresponding location, if applicable, in the other. In general, "corresponding location" is
    computed using information about loaded modules reported by the debugger. For the finer
    details, see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window. When you navigate to a location contained by a module, but there is no corresponding
    static location, the listing logs a "missing module" to the console, offering either to import
    the module or map it to an existing program.</P>

    <H3><A name="capture_memory"></A>Capture Memory</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the current trace is "at the present" with a live target, and
    there is a selection of addresses in the dynamic listing. It will instruct the recorder to
    capture the contents of memory for the selected range(s). Typically, the viewable addresses are
    automatically captured &mdash; see the Auto-Read action.</P>

    <H3><A name="auto_memory"></A>Auto-Read Memory</H3>

    <P>This action is always available on all dynamic listings. It configures whether or not the
    memory range(s) displayed in the listing are automatically captured. Like the Capture Memory
    action, capture can only occur when the current trace is "at the present" with a live target.
    It occurs when the user scrolls the listing, or when the listing is otherwise navigated to a
    new location. Note that other components may capture memory, regardless of this listing's
    configuration. For example, the recorder typically captures the page of memory pointed to by
    the program counter. In other words, this action <EM>cannot</EM> "disable all memory captures."
    The options are pluggable, but currently consist of:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Do Not Read Memory - disables automatic memory capture <EM>for this listing
      only</EM>.</LI>

      <LI>Read Visible Memory - automatically reads stale ranges that enter this listing's
      view.</LI>

      <LI>Read Visible Memory, RO Once - (default) behaves like Read Visible Memory, except it will
      neglect to capture read-only ranges that have been captured previously.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2><A name="colors"></A>Tool Options: Colors</H2>

    <P>The memory-state and tracked-location background colors can all be configured here.</P>
