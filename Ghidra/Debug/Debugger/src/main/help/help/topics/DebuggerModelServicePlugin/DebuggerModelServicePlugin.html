    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Model Service</H1>

    <P>This service plugin backs the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTargetsPlugin/DebuggerTargetsPlugin.html">Targets</A> window. It maintains
    all debugger connections across the entire Ghidra session, that is, they're shared across all
    tools.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The plugin also provides some shortcut actions.</P>

    <H3><A name="debug_program"></A> Debug Program</H3>

    <P>This group of actions is available whenever there exists a debug launcher that knows how to
    run the current program. Various launchers may all make offers to run the current program, each
    of which is presented as a item in this group. Not all offers are guaranteed to work. For
    example, an offer to launch the program remotely via SSH depends on the host's availability and
    the user's credentials. The offers are ordered by most recent activation. The most recent offer
    used is the default one-click launcher for the current program. Each launcher may check various
    conditions before making an offer. Most commonly, it will check that there is a suitable
    debugger for the current program's architecture (language) on the local system, that the
    program's original executable image still exists on disk, and that the user has permission to
    execute it. A launcher may take any arbitrary action to run the program. Most commonly, it
    starts a new connection suitable for the target, and then launches the program on that
    connection. If <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#record_automatically">Record
    Automatically</A> is enabled, this will provide a one-click action to debug the current
    program. This is similar to the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#quick_launch">Quick Launch</A>
    action in the Commands and Objects window, except this one does not require an existing
    connection.</P>

    <P>The launch offers are presented in two places. First, they are listed as drop-down items
    from the "Debug Program" action in the main toolbar. When activated here, there are typically
    no further prompts. One notable exception is SSH, where authentication may be required. Second,
    they are listed under the <SPAN class="menu">Debugger &rarr; Debug Program</SPAN> menu. When
    activated here, the launcher should prompt for arguments. The chosen arguments are saved as the
    default for future launches of the current program.</P>

    <H3><A name="disconnect_all"></A> Disconnect All</H3>

    <P>This action is always available from the main application window. It closes all debugger
    connections, no matter what tool created them. This is a sort of panic and reset action.</P>
