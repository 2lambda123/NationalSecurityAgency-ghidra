    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

    </TABLE>

    <P>Registers refer to the target processor's register banks. In multi-threaded environments, it
    is assumed that each thread has its own register context. The register window presents a subset
    of registers for the current thread understood by both the target and Ghidra's language model
    for the target processor. It permits for the selection, organization, display, search,
    modification, and analysis of the registers and values.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table displays information about registers, including their values and types. It has the
    following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Favorite - a toggle to mark the register as a favorite. By default this includes the
      program counter and stack pointer. Favorites are sorted to the top, by default. The list of
      favorite registers is memorized per compiler specification.</LI>

      <LI>Number - the index of the register in Ghidra's language model. By default, this is the
      second sort column.</LI>

      <LI>Name - the name of the register in Ghidra's language model.</LI>

      <LI>Value - the value of the register as recorded in the trace. When the value refers to a
      valid memory offset, right-clicking the row allows the user to navigate to that offset in a
      selected memory space. This field is user modifiable when the target is alive, the trace is
      "at the present," and the <B>Enable Edits</B> toggle is on. Changes to the register's value
      are sent to the target. Values changed by the last event are displayed in <FONT color=
      "red">red</FONT>.</LI>

      <LI>Type - the type of the register as marked up in the trace. There is generally no default
      here. Either the user or some automation, e.g., analysis, may set this value. Changes to this
      field <EM>do not</EM> affect the target. The selected type is saved to the trace "from this
      time on."</LI>

      <LI>Representation - the value of the register as interpreted by its data type. If the value
      is an address, double-clicking this field will navigate to it.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The register window provides the following actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="select_registers"></A><A name="add"></A><A name="remove"></A><IMG alt="" src=
    "images/select-registers.png"> Select Registers</H3>

    <P>This displays a dialog for selecting which registers to display in the table.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src=
          "images/DebuggerAvailableRegistersDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The dialog provides more information about each register, potentially displays a larger set
    of registers, and permits the precise selection of registers to include in the window. This
    varies from using the table filter in that the register window will not query the target for a
    register unless it is selected. Note that de-selecting a register does not prohibit other
    components from reading that register. For example, the program counter and stack pointer are
    read by the recorder whether or not they're displayed in the table. The actions allow for the
    addition and subtraction of selections from the register set. Most columns are self-explanator
    or duplicate the same column in the main window. The "Known" column indicates whether Ghidra
    was able to find the same register on the target. Unknown registers are never populated by the
    recorder, but they can still be populated by the user. Modifying the values of unknown
    registers cannot affect the target. Register sets are memorized per compiler specification.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_edits"></A>Enable Edits</H3>

    <P>This toggle is a write protector for live registers. To modify live register values, this
    toggle must be enabled, and the trace must be live and "at the present." Note that editing
    recorded historical values is not permitted via the UI, regardless of this toggle, but can be
    accomplished via scripts.</P>

    <H3><A name="snapshot_window"></A>Snapshot Window</H3>

    <P>This button is analogous to the "snapshot" action of other Ghidra windows. It generates a
    copy of this window. The copy will no longer follow the current thread, but it will follow the
    current time.</P>

    <H2><A name="colors"></A>Tool Options: Colors</H2>

    <P>The register window uses colors to hint about the state of registers and their values. They
    can be configured in the tool's options. By default, changed registers are displayed in red,
    and stale registers are displayed in dark grey. A "stale" register is one whose current value
    is not known. The value displayed is the last recorded value or the default value 0. Simply, a
    "changed" register is one whose value has just changed. For example, if a register is modified
    as result of stepping, then that register is changed. However, given the possibility of
    rewinding, changing thread focus, etc., "changed" is actually subtly more flexible. The
    registers window remembers the user's last coordinates (time, thread, frame, etc.) as well as
    the current coordinates. So, "changed" more precisely refers to a register whose value differs
    between those two coordinates. This permits the user to switch focus between different
    coordinates and quickly identify what is different, so long as those coordinates pertain to the
    same processor language.</P>
