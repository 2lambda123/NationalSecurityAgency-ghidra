    <P><A name="Toggle_Header"></A>The memory, or dynamic bytes, window is analogous to Ghidra's
    bytes window for static analysis, but in the dynamic context. It displays memory contents from
    a target. More precisely, it displays recorded memory contents in a trace. In most use cases,
    that trace is "at the present," meaning it is the most recent memory from a live target.
    Multiple memory windows can be displayed simultaneously, using the same pattern as many other
    Ghidra windows. The "primary" window is always displayed and generally tracks with the rest of
    the tool. Any window can be "snapshotted," i.e., cloned. This is where memory windows differ
    from static bytes windows. Static clones remain in place; they do not automatically navigate.
    Dynamic clones can still be configured to navigate, following the rest of the tool. A common
    use is to configure a clone to follow the stack pointer. Still, you can disable a window's
    automatic navigation, so it behaves like a true clone. A current limitation is that you cannot
    use clones to display different points in time for the same trace.</P>

    <P>Because not all memory is recorded, some background coloring is used to indicate the state
    of attempted memory reads. Regardless of state, the most-recent contents, as recorded in the
    trace, are displayed in the window, defaulting to 00. "Stale" memory, that is ranges of memory
    which have not been read at the current time, are displayed with a darker background. Where
    that memory is marked "read-only" and has been successfully read previously, that coloring is
    subdued, since the contents are not likely to have changed. Where a read was attempted but
    failed, the first address in the failed range is displayed with a pink background. Otherwise,
    up-to-date contents are displayed with the default background color.</P>

    <P>The dynamic bytes viewer supports editing memory. See <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerControlPlugin/DebuggerControlPlugin.html">Control and Machine State</A>.
    Such edits are performed as usual: Toggling edits and typing into the editor, or by pasting
    byte strings. These edits may be directed toward a live target, the trace, or the emulator.
    <B>NOTE:</B> Please be wary of hand-typing large edits into the emulator, since every keystroke
    may produce a unique scratch snapshot. It is better to paste such edits instead.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The memory window provides a variety of actions, some for managing and configuring windows,
    and others for capturing memory from a target.</P>

    <H3><A name="new_memory"></A>New Memory View</H3>

    <P>This action is always available in the <SPAN class="menu">Window &rarr; Debugger</SPAN>
    menu. It creates a new memory window with the same configuration as the primary memory window.
    It is equivalent to cloning the primary memory window.</P>

    <H3><A name="follows_thread"></A>Follows Selected Thread</H3>

    <P>This action is only available on cloned memory windows. The primary window always follows
    the tool's current thread. Disabling this toggle causes the clone to remain on its own current
    thread rather than following the tool's. The current thread is used when computing a location
    to navigate to automatically. It is only applicable when "Track Location" is set to something
    other than "Do Not Track."</P>

    <H3><A name="track_location"></A>Track Location</H3>

    <P>This action is equivalent to the same action in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html#track_location">Dynamic
    Listing</A> window. <B>NOTE:</B> This feature is disabled when the edit toggle is on.</P>

    <H3><A name="go_to"></A>Go To (G)</H3>

    <P>This action is equivalent to the same action in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html#go_to">Dynamic Listing</A>
    window.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src=
          "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/images/DebuggerGoToDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <H3><A name="read_memory"></A>Read Memory</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the current trace is "at the present" with a live target, and
    there is a selection of addresses in the memory window. It will instruct the recorder to read
    and record the contents of memory for the selected range(s). Typically, the viewable addresses
    are automatically read &mdash; see the Auto-Read action.</P>

    <H3><A name="auto_memory"></A>Auto-Read Memory</H3>

    <P>This action is always available on all memory windows. It configures whether or not the
    memory range(s) displayed in the window are automatically read and recorded. Like the Read
    Memory action, it is only permitted when the current trace is "at the present" with a live
    target. It occurs when the user scrolls the window, or when the window is otherwise navigated
    to a new location. Note that other components may read memory, regardless of this windows's
    configuration. For example, the recorder typically reads the page of memory pointed to by the
    program counter. In other words, this action <EM>cannot</EM> "disable all memory reads." The
    options are pluggable, but currently consist of:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Do Not Read Memory - disables automatic memory reads <EM>for this window only</EM>.</LI>

      <LI>Read Visible Memory - automatically reads stale ranges that enter this window's
      view.</LI>

      <LI>Read Visible Memory, RO Once - (default) behaves like Read Visible Memory, except it will
      neglect read-only ranges that have been read previously.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3><A name="Byte_Viewer_Options"></A>Byte Viewer Options</H3>

    <P>This action does the same as it does for the static context.</P>

    <H3><A name="Enable_Disable_Byteviewer_Editing"></A>Toggle Editing</H3>

    <P>This action does the same as it does for the static context. Edits may be rejected if the
    trace's editing mode is set to Read-Only in the tool. <B>NOTE:</B> This toggle also disables
    automatic navigation in order to prevent the cursor from being moved unexpectedly while typing
    edits.</P>
