    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

    <P>A static mapping refers to a range of addresses in the dynamic listing and its corresponding
    range in the static listing. These mappings provide a flexible means of mapping imported
    images, i.e., Ghidra Program Databases, into a trace. Typically, this table is populated by
    automation, e.g., the <A href="help/topics/DebuggerBots/DebuggerBots.html#map_modules">Map
    Modules</A> bot, or by higher-level user actions, e.g., the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html#map_modules">Map Modules</A>
    action. This under-the-hood static mapping window dislays the mappings table, allowing users or
    developers to diagnose image mapping issues and manually add mappings, regardless of reported
    modules and/or sections. For most users, there is no reason to access this window.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Dynamic Address - the minimum address in the dynamic address range.</LI>

      <LI>Static Program - the Ghidra URL of the imported static image.</LI>

      <LI>Static Address - the minimum address in the static address range.</LI>

      <LI>Length - the number of bytes in each address range.</LI>

      <LI>Shift - the offset from static address to dynamic address.</LI>

      <LI>Lifespan - the span of time for which this mapping is applicable.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>This window provides actions for finding, adding, and removing mappings. Note that entries
    cannot be modified.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_rows"></A>Select Rows</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the active listing's (dynamic or static) cursor is at a valid
    location. It selects the mapping containing that cursor. If the active listing has a selection,
    it selects all mappings intersecting that selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="add"></A>Add Mapping</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one primary listing (dynamic or static) has a selection, and
    the other's cursor is at a valid location. It will add a mapping, using the selection's size
    and minimum address, and the cursor as the corresponding minimum address. The lifespan given is
    "from now on out", i.e., the current time to infinity.</P>

    <H3><A name="remove"></A>Remove Mapping</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one mapping is selected. It removes those
    mappings.</P>
