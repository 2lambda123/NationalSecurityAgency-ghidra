      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

    <P>The stack window displays the current trace's execution stack, as unwound and reported by
    the target. Not all debuggers will unwind the stack, in which case, this window displays only
    the innermost frame. When emulation is used to generate the current machine state, only a
    single synthetic frame is shown. See the <A href="#unwind_stack">Unwind Stack</A> action for an
    alternative mechanism that unwinds using Ghidra's program databases and works with emulation.
    Level 0 always refers to the innermost frame, and each incremental level refers to the next
    caller in the chain &mdash; most of the time. The current frame comprises one element of the
    tool's current "coordinates." Double-clicking a frame changes those coordinates, potentially
    causing other windows to display different information. Namely, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A> window will
    show registers for the current frame, assuming they can be retrieved. The Listings may also
    navigate to the current frame's program counter.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The stack table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Level - the level of the frame, counting 0-up starting at the innermost frame.</LI>

      <LI>PC - the address of the instruction to execute next, or upon return of the callee for
      non-0 frames. Different platforms may have different subtleties in how they report PC.</LI>

      <LI>Function - the name of the containing function, if Ghidra has the corresponding module
      image imported and analyzed.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - a user-modifiable comment.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Action</H2>

    <P>The stack plugin provides a single action:</P>

    <H3><A name="unwind_stack">Unwind Stack (U)</A></H3>

    <P>This action is in the main menu: <SPAN class="menu">Debugger &rarr; Analysis &rarr; Unwind
    from frame 0</SPAN>. It attempts to unwind the current thread's stack segment, creating frame
    data units in the listing. It starts by reading the program counter and stack pointer from the
    innermost frame of the current thread. It then maps the program counter to the program database
    and analyzes the function containing it. If successful, it can determine the frame's base
    address and locate variables, saved registers, and the return address. Knowing the return
    address and frame depth, it can derive the program counter and stack pointer of the next frame
    and unwind it in the same manner. This proceeds until analysis fails or the stack segment is
    exhausted. For best results, ensure you have imported and opened the Ghidra program database
    for every module, or at least the subset you expect to see in your stack. To view the results,
    navigate to or follow the stack pointer in a Dynamic Listing. The Stack window <EM>does
    not</EM> display Ghidra's unwinding results.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=
          "images/DebuggerStackUnwindInListing.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>Each call record generates a structure data unit derived from the function's frame. The
    exact contents of the structure depend on the current program counter within that function.
    Only those entries actually allocated at the program counter are included. Each field in that
    structure can be one of five kinds:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Local stack variable:</B> These are named with the <CODE>local_</CODE> prefix. They
      correspond exactly to those entries found in the function's stack frame in the program
      database.</LI>

      <LI><B>Stack parameter:</B> These are named with the <CODE>param_</CODE> prefix. They
      correspond exactly to those entries found in the function's stack frame in the program
      database.</LI>

      <LI><B>Return address:</B> This is named <CODE>return_address</CODE>. It is determined by
      interpreting the function's machine code.</LI>

      <LI><B>Saved register:</B> These are named with the <CODE>saved_</CODE> prefix. They are
      determined by interpreting the function's machine code.</LI>

      <LI><B>Slack space:</B> These are named with the <CODE>offset_</CODE> prefix (or
      <CODE>posOff_</CODE> for positive offsets). They represent unused or unknown entries.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The frame entries are <EM>not</EM> automatically updated when a function's frame changes in
    a program database. To update the unwind after changing a function's stack frame, you must
    unwind again.</P>
