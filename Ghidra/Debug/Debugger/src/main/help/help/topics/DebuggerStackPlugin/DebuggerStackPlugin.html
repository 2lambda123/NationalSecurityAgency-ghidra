    <P>The stack window displays the current trace's execution stack, as unwound and reported by
    the target. Not all debuggers will unwind the stack, in which case, this window displays a
    synthetic innermost frame. When emulation was used to generate the current machine state, only
    a synthetic frame is shown. Level 0 always refers to the innermost frame, and each incremental
    level refers to the next caller in the chain &mdash; most of the time. The current frame
    comprises one element of the tool's current "coordinates." Selecting a frame changes those
    coordinates, potentially causing other windows to display different information. Namely, the <A
    href="help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A> window
    will show registers for the current frame, assuming they can be retrieved. The Listings may
    also navigate to the current frame's program counter.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The stack table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Level - the level of the frame, counting 0-up starting at the innermost frame.</LI>

      <LI>PC - the address of the instruction to execute next, or upon return of the callee for
      non-0 frames. Different platforms may have different subtleties in how they report PC.
      Double-clicking this field will navigate to the address.</LI>

      <LI>Function - the name of the containing function, if Ghidra has the corresponding module
      image imported and analyzed.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - a user-modifiable comment.</LI>
