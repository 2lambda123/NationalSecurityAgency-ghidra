    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Editing Machine State</H1>

    <P>This plugin controls the modification of machine state. It provides a multi-state action in
    the main toolbar for controlling the editing mode of each trace and associated target. It is
    backed by a corresponding service plugin which manages the editing modes and dispatches
    machine-state edits accordingly. Scripts can also use the service to perform machine-state
    edits that behave consistently with the rest of the UI.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The plugin provides a single action:</P>

    <H3><A name="edit_mode"></A>Edit Mode</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a trace is active. It changes the machine-state editing
    mode for the active trace and, if applicable, its associated target. The possible modes
    are:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-disabled.png"> Read-Only - Rejects all edits.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-target.png"> Write Target - The default, this directs edits
      to the live target. To accept changes, the UI must be "live and at the present." If the trace
      has no associated target, i.e., it is dead; or if the current view is in the past or includes
      any steps of emulation, i.e., it is not at the present; then edits are rejected.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-trace.png"> Write Trace - Directs all edits to the trace.
      Edits are generally always accepted, and they are applied directly to the trace.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-emulator.png"> Write Emulator - Materializes edits via
      emulation. Instead of editing the trace, this generates a patch and appends it to the current
      coordinates' emulation schedule. See the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerThreadsPlugin/DebuggerThreadsPlugin.html#goto_time">Go To Time</A>
      action. Essentially, the change is applied in the trace's scratch space, leaving the original
      recording in tact. Due to implementation details, a thread must be selected, even if edits
      only affect memory. Additionally, the disassembly context register cannot be modified.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Recommendations</H2>

    <P>Write Target is the default mode, because in most cases, this is the desired behavior. When
    the target dies, Write Target essentially means Read Only. For the most part, modifying the
    recording itself is discouraged. There are few reasons, perhaps including 1) Hand-generating an
    experimental trace; 2) Generating a trace from a script, e.g., importing an event log,
    recording an emulated target; 3) Patching in state missed by the original recording. More often
    than not, when experimenting with the emulator, the mode should be Write Emulator. Using Write
    Trace with the emulator will almost certainly result in issues with cache staleness.</P>

    <P>Some background and an example: To display emulated machine state, the emulator executes a
    specified schedule and writes the resulting state into the trace's scratch space, keyed by the
    schedule. Suppose you emulate a step forward but then realize that some state was incorrect, or
    you just want to try the same step with an alternative initial state. If you step back then
    edit the trace and then repeat the step forward, the UI will simply recall the cached snapshot,
    rendering the state change ineffective. Instead, use Write Emulator to edit the state and then
    step forward. Because the patch is encoded in the emulation schedule, the UI will not recall
    the stale snapshot. Instead the emulator will execute the new schedule and generate a new
    scratch snapshot. Furthermore, the original trace recording remains in tact, while the modified
    state is stored in scratch space with the schedule explaining where it came from. Still better,
    the first scratch snapshot (for the step taken without first modifying the state) also remains
    in tact, and the two can be <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTraceViewDiffPlugin/DebuggerTraceViewDiffPlugin.html">compared</A>.</P>

    <P>To prevent edits to a live target, use the Read-Only mode. This will prevent most accidental
    edits. This is only effective against edits from the UI, and only when all plugins and scripts
    use the state editing service. This cannot prevent a component from accessing Ghidra's Target
    API to modify a target. Nor can it prevent edits via the connected debugger's command-line
    interpreter. The following components all use the service: <A href=
