        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The Debugger's Objects window permits the user to interact directly with a connected
    debugger and its targets. Along with the command-line, it is the primary mechanism for issuing
    commands, e.g., <B>step</B>, to a target. Commands are accessible from the tool bar, the
    pull-down, and pop-up menus. Commands are enabled in two ways: (1) the object selected has a
    property that marks it as a logical target for that command, or (2) the object has an ancestor
    for which the command makes sense. The <A href=
    "DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#act_on_selection_only">Enable By Selection Only</A> function
    determines whether both options are in play. For example, threads and inferiors/processes are
    both <B>resumable</B>, so the <A href="DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#resume">Resume</A> action
    works on both. For many of our targets, processes are <B>interruptible</B> while threads are
    not. Nevertheless, if <B>Enable By Selection Only</B> is off, you can interrupt a thread
    because it descends from an inferior or process. In almost every case, the selection directly
    or indirectly determines the set of valid or enabled actions.</P>

    <P>The application of these special properties to each object to determine its behavior and
    relevant actions allows all objects to be treated generically. This feature has several
    powerful implications. All objects may be represented in many ways, and one representation may
    easily be converted into another. The default representation is a tree, and the Debugger's
    Objects plugin starts with a tree to represent a debugger session's state. Any portion of the
    tree may be reproduced as its own subtree or as a table or as a graph using the <A href=
    "DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#display_as">Display as...</A> actions. Any portion of display may
    equally be exported or imported from the plugin. The generic aspect of all objects also allows
    the user to process them in scripts or plugins in common ways. For example, you could write a
    script to walk the entire tree and find objects with "File" in the name or with the value
    0xDEADBEEF.</P>

    <P>The hierarchy reflected in the initial display has either been derived from the target, as
    in the case of WinDbg v.2's dbgmodel engine, or imposed by the designers of the current
    "model". The model is the schema chosen by the authors for a particular debugger target. It
    usually mirrors to some extent the underlying relationships in the native debugger, but need
    not, and is usually fixed for that target. (In the future, we intend to expose this schema and
    allow it to be transformed by the user.) Commands executed within this plugin are passed from
    the GUI through the model to the target manager and on to the agent which makes the required
    native calls. In general, this plugin does not operate on any object in a trace or controlled
    by a recorder, except for actions which initiate a recording or add objects to a recording.</P>

    <H3><A name="console"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/console.png"> Console</H3>

    <P>Shows the console for the selected context, usually the debugger's command-line interpreter.
    Some models may also present a target's standard I/O via a console.</P>

    <H2>Target Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions manage targets, e.g., processes, within a connected debugger.</P>

    <H3><A name="quick_launch"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/debugger.png"> Quick Launch</H3>

    <P>Launch a new target using the current program.</P>

    <P>This action is the fastest and probably most common way of starting a debugger target. The
    action attempts to launch the program in the currently selected tab of the static listing
    window. The success of the action depends on the program being associated with an existing
    executable file on the local system. The value associated with the program may, of course, be
    checked using the <A href="help/topics/About/About_Program_File.htm">About Program File</A>
    function.</P>

    <H3><A name="launch"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/launch.png"> Launch</H3>

    <P>Launch a new target. Sometimes you may wish to launch a program which has not been imported,
    to launch a program with various configuration options, or to pass arguments to the program.
    The launch dialog allows you to do this. Typically, the dialog will present a single empty box
    into which you can enter the command with arguments as you would on a command line. For some
    targets, the dialog will present pre-configured options corresponding to common launch modes
    for the platform.</P>

    <P>For example, the CommandLineLaunch version of the dialog for JDI targets displays a check
    box for whether the target shuld be suspended on launch, the default quote character used by
    the command line, the program used to start the virtual machine (java), the path to where it's
    installed, and fields for the name of the class and any user options you might supply:</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=
          "images/DebuggerMethodInvocationDialog_ForLaunch.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The options displayed by the Launch command are, for some targets, connected to the
    currently selected item under Connectors. For example, the Windows tree offers four possible
    connectors: one for command-line launch, one for attach, open for kernel-mode debugging, and
    one for opening previously-generated dump or trace files.</P>

    <H3><A name="attach"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/attach.png"> Attach</H3>

    <P>Attach to a running target</P>

    <P>If the debugger has available a list of running targets for the local system, the attach
    action provides a convenient way to select and attach to an existing process. If the
    highlighted object in the provider is considered "attachable", the attach action attempts to
    connect that element. The list of "attachable" targets is typically displayed in the tree under
    <B>Session/Available</B>. Bare in mind it often takes time to populate the <B>Available</B>
    list, which may need to be manually refreshed.</P>

    <H3><A name="detach"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/detach.png"> Detach</H3>

    <P>Detach from the selected target, usually allowing it to resume execution. (This action
    terminates the current trace for the target, if applicable, but does not close it.)</P>

    <H3><A name="re-attach"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/attach.png"> Re-attach</H3>

    <P>Re-attaches to the selected target. (Some targets require a separate action for re-attaching
    vs. attaching for the first time. If so, this action provides that capability.)</P>

    <H3><A name="kill"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/kill.png"> Kill</H3>

    <P>Kill this current target. (As with <B>detach</B>, this terminates a current trace, if
    applicable, but does not close it.)</P>

    <H2>Execution Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions manage execution state of a target.</P>

    <H3><A name="interrupt"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stop.png"> Interrupt (Pause, Suspend,
    Break)</H3>

    <P>Interrupt the current target's execution.</P>

    <H3><A name="resume"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/continue.png"> Resume (Continue, Go)</H3>

    <P>Allow the current target to resume execution.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_into"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png"> Step Into</H3>

    <P>Step the current target to the next instruction.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_over"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepover.png"> Step Over</H3>

    <P>Step the current target to the next instruction in the current subroutine.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_finish"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepout.png"> Finish</H3>

    <P>Allow the current target to finish the current subroutine, pausing after.</P>

    <H3><A name="set_breakpoint"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-set.png"> Set
    Breakpoint</H3>

    <P>Set a breakpoint, which will trap target execution under certain conditions.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center"><IMG alt="" border="1" src="images/DebuggerBreakpointDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The given expression can follow any form accepted by the connected debugger, although most
    often this will be an address. The listing can only set breakpoints on specific addresses, not
    symbols or expressions. The listing is also not available until the target is being recorded.
    For a recorded target, breakpoints can also be managed in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointsPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointsPlugin.html">Breakpoints</A> window
    or using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoint
    Marker</A> actions from the disassembly listings.</P>

    <H2>Trace Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions manage target tracing. Note that many other windows are not usable
    until a target is recorded into a trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="record"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/record.png"> Record</H3>

    <P>Record the current target, if its platform is recognized, and open its trace. If Ghidra
    cannot uniquely identify the platform, it may prompt the user to select from a list of
    possibilities.</P>

    <H3><A name="record_automatically"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/record.png"> Record
    Automatically</H3>

    <P>Automatically record and open recognized targets. If Ghidra cannot uniquely identify the
    platform, it will select one by priority without prompting the user.</P>

    <H2><A name="display_as"></A>Display Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions can create additional displays of portions of the debugger model.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_tree"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_tree.png"> Display As
    Tree</H3>

    <P>Constructs a new tree using the selection as the new root, synchronized with the current
    provider.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_table"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_table.png"> Display As
    Table</H3>

    <P>Constructs a table from the current object, synchronized with the current provider. If the
    object is a container, its elements will be rows in the new table and their attributes will be
    columns. If not, the attributes will be rows and their name, kind, value, and type will be
    columns.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_graph"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_graph.png"> Display As
    Graph</H3>

    <P>Constructs and displays a graph from the selection and its visible descendants. (The graph
    does not currently maintain synchronization.)</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_xml.png"> Display As
    XML</H3>

    <P>Encodes the selected object and its visible descendants in XML and prints the result to the
    console. (Note: various characters not allowed in XML may be converted, typically to
    underscores, in the result.)</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_tree"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_tree.png">
    Display Filtered Tree</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as a tree,
    applying a filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_table"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_table.png">
    Display Filtered Table</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as a table,
    applying a filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_graph"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_graph.png">
    Display Filtered Graph</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as a graph,
    applying a filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_xml.png">
    Display Filtered XML</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as XML, applying a
    filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_methods"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/blank.png"> Display Methods</H3>

    <P>Displays a list of the methods available for the selection, which may be applied and
    combined in a filter.</P>

    <H2>Data Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions can export and import model information.</P>

    <H3><A name="export_as_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/export_as_xml.png"> Export as XML</H3>

    <P>Convert the selection and its visible descendants to XML and export the result to a file of
    the user's choosing.</P>

    <H3><A name="import_from_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/import_from_xml.png"> Import from
    XML</H3>

    <P>Import "facts" from a file of the user's choosing and render it as a tree.</P>

    <H3><A name="export_as_facts"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/export_as_facts.png"> Export as
    Facts</H3>

    <P>Convert the selection and its visible descendants to "fact" files and export the result to a
    directory of the user's choosing. (Currently, "fact" files itemize the path, name, value, type,
    and children for each object.)</P>

    <H3><A name="import_from_facts"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/import_from_facts.png"> Import from
    Facts</H3>

    <P>Import XML from a directory of the user's choosing and render them as a tree.</P>

    <H3><A name="open_trace"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/text-xml.png"> Import from trace</H3>

    <P>Import from trace is roughly equivalent to using the open dump/trace connector.</P>

    <H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

    <P>The following actions are for maintenance or experiments</P>

    <H3><A name="refresh"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/reload.png"> Refresh Node</H3>

    <P>Queries the model for the current object's children and rebuilds that portion of the
    display.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_subscription">Subscribe / Unsubscribe to Selection</A></H3>

    <P>Asks the recorder to include or exclude the current object from the trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="act_on_selection_only"></A>Enable By Selection Only</H3>

    <P>Toggles the scope of the other action menus. If "selection only" is chosen, the current
    object must have the property used to enable the particular action. For instance, the
    <B>step</B> action will only be enabled for objects marked <B>steppable</B>. If "selection
    only" is off, the debugger will walk the path up from the current object looking for an
    ancestor for which the action is enabled. For example, if threads are <B>steppable</B> and
    contain registers as children, <B>step</B> will still be enabled for that thread if the current
    selection is one of its registers.</P>

    <H3><A name="hide_intrinsic_attributes"></A>Hide Intrinsic Attributes</H3>

    <P>Toggle which objects are visible (mostly for diagnostic purposes). Attributes for each
    object may be split into those that convey information intended for the user and those that
    convey information for the debugger. The latter are not normally visible, because they just
    clutter the display. However, under certain circumstances, the user may want to see them. For
    example, the <B>_update_mode</B> attribute determines when node is refreshed, and the
    <B>_state</B> attribute indicates whether a thread is running or stopped. In the latter case,
    this information is reflected for the user in the display, but the invisible attribute actually
    determines the behavior.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_ignore_state">Ignore State</A></H3>

    <P>Many actions are normally allowed only if the target is stopped or in some other defined
    state. Sometimes you may wish to ignore the current state and force the action, as, for
    example, when the debugger has lost track of the true state.</P>

    <H2><A name="color"></A>Color Options</H2>

    <P>The debugger represents different types of objects with different colors. Bare in mind these
    colors are not blended, i.e. one color may override another. Examples include:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Default: normal objects</LI>

      <LI>Modified: objects recently changed</LI>

      <LI>Links: objects from a different portion of the display</LI>

      <LI>Intrinsics: objects with a value, such as strings or numbers</LI>

      <LI>Invisible: objects used internally by the provider</LI>

      <LI>Accessors: objects which may used to supply other objects (before they've been
      populated)</LI>

      <LI>Targets: native objects with special properties</LI>
