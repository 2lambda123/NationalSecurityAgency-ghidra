    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Trace Management</H1>

    <P>This service plugin manages the collection of open traces, and it controlled primarily via
    the <A href="help/topics/DebuggerThreadsPlugin/DebuggerThreadsPlugin.html">Threads</A> window.
    It maintains a list of open traces, the active trace coordinates (trace, time, thread, frame),
    and permits saving, opening, and closing traces. To some extent, it also tracks which traces
    are being actively recorded.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The plugin provides the following actions and toggles:</P>

    <H3><A name="open_trace"></A>Open Trace</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It prompts for a trace in the current project and opens
    that trace in the tool.</P>

    <H3><A name="save_trace"></A>Save Trace</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever at least one trace is open and active. It saves the
    current trace. If the current trace is not in any project, it saves it under "New Traces" of
    the current project.</P>

    <H3><A name="close_trace"></A>Close Trace</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever at least one trace is open and active. It closes the
    current trace. <FONT color="red">WARNING:</FONT> If the trace has not been saved, it will be
    lost, even when Save by Default is active.</P>

    <H3><A name="close_all_traces"></A>Close All Traces</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever at least one trace is open. It closes all traces in this
    tool. <FONT color="red">WARNING:</FONT> Any trace that has not been saved will be lost, even
    when Save by Default is active.</P>

    <H3><A name="close_other_traces"></A>Close Other Traces</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever there is an open trace other than the active one --
    usually two or more open traces. It closes all traces in this tool, except the active trace.
    <FONT color="red">WARNING:</FONT> Any closed trace that has not been saved will be lost, even
    when Save by Default is active.</P>

    <H3><A name="close_dead_traces"></A>Close Dead Traces</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever at least one trace is open. It closes all dead traces in
    this tool. <FONT color="red">WARNING:</FONT> Any closed trace that has not been saved will be
    lost, even when Save by Default is active.</P>

    <H3><A name="save_by_default"></A>Save by Default</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available. If the tool is closed with this toggle enabled, all open
    traces are immediately saved. Note that if Ghidra is abruptly terminated (a rare occurrence
    under normal use), traces may not be saved. When the tool is re-opened, the open traces are
    also restored.</P>

    <H3><A name="auto_close_terminated"></A>Close Traces on Termination</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available. If a target terminates with this toggle enabled, and it was
    being recorded into a trace, that trace is automatically closed. If Save by Default is active,
    the trace is saved.</P>
