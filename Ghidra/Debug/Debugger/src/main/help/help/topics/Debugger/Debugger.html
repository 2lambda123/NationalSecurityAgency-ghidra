    <H1><A name="package"></A>Ghidra Debugger</H1>

    <P>The Debugger is a collection of plugins comprising Ghidra's Dynamic Analysis Framework. This
    includes a platform for connecting to and controlling debuggers. Ghidra is not a debugger in
    itself, but rather, it relies on existing 3rd-party debuggers, their APIs, wire protocols,
    and/or command-line interfaces. Such connectors are pluggable, allowing Ghidra to be extended
    and integrated with additional debuggers.</P>

    <P>When Ghidra recognizes the platform of a target in a connected debugger, it can record that
    target into a local database and display the target state. Without recording, the UI will at
    least allow interaction through a generic model and/or the debugger's command-line interface.
    The recording, called a Trace in Ghidra, logs all the observations made by the framework or the
    user. The user can rewind this recording at any point and the UI will recall those
    observations, displaying the recorded machine state instead of the present machine state. These
    traces can also be saved, loaded, and analyzed after a target has terminated or been
    disconnected. Furthermore, they can be commited to a Ghidra Server for sharing and revision
    control; however, conflicting changes <EM>cannot</EM> be merged.</P>

    <P>A system of mappings, which is usually populated automatically, tracks the relationship of
    imported Ghidra programs to modules recorded in a trace. By default, Ghidra will synchronize
    the cursor in the dynamic listing with that in the static listing, and encourage the user to
    import missing modules. In this way, existing static analysis is readily at hand during a
    dynamic analysis session, and the user can further populate program databases during a
    debugging session. However, target memories contain more spaces than program images, e.g.,
    stack and heap space, and some of those spaces are modified at runtime, e.g., .bss or .data.
    This information, if observed, is dutifully recorded into the trace for immediate or offline
    analysis.</P>

    <P>A variety of plugins allow the user to interact with the target directly, view and
    manipulate machine state, set breakpoints, view recordings, etc. See the table of contents for
    a comprehensive list of current plugins. Plugins generally fall into one of these
    categories:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Target manipulation - those used for managing connections and interacting with targets,
      regardless of tracing</LI>

      <LI>Trace manipulation - those used for viewing and manipulating the trace database,
      including machine state inspection. Most of these behave differently when the view is "at the
      present," i.e., corresponds to a live target machine state. They may directly command and/or
      request additional information from the target.</LI>

      <LI>Global manipulation - those which aggregate information from several targets or traces,
      presenting a comprehensive picture. Modifications in these views may be directed to any
      target or affect any trace, depending on the context of the user action.</LI>

      <LI>Services - those which do not present their own windows, but manage information and/or
      add actions and options to other windows.</LI>
    </OL>

    <P>This package is already enabled in the default "Debugger" tool. You may need to import the
    tool using the <SPAN class="menu">Tools &rarr; Import Default Tools</SPAN> menu from Ghidra's
    project window. You may also add the package to an existing tool using the <SPAN class=
    "menu">File &rarr; Configure</SPAN> menu from your tool window and selecting "Debugger."</P>
