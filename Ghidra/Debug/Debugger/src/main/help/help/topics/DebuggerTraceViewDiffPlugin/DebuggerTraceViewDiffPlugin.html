    </TABLE>

    <P><A name="Toggle_Header"></A>A common strategy in dynamic analysis is to compare machine
    state between two points in time. To this end, to support comparison of bytes in memory, the
    "trace diff" plugin extends the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Dynamic Listing</A> to provide
    side-by-side comparison of two different points in time. When active, listings for both points
    in time are displayed and the byte value differences between them are highlighted. <B>NOTE:</B>
    This does not compare annotations. It only compares raw byte values. Additionally, all stale
    values are ignored, i.e., to show as a difference, the memory must be observed at <EM>both</EM>
    points in time, and the values must differ.</P>

    <P><B>NOTE:</B> This plugin only facilitates the comparison of memory displayed in listings. To
    compare registers or SLEIGH expressions, use the respective windows: <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A> and <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerWatchesPlugin/DebuggerWatchesPlugin.html">Watches</A>. By navigating back
    and forth between two points in time, using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time Window</A>, the differences are
    displayed in <FONT color="red">red</FONT>.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The plugin adds actions to the main Dynamic Listing. When active, additional actions are
    present.</P>

    <H3><A name="compare"></A>Compare</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a trace is active in the main listing. It prompts for an
    alternative point in time:</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src=
          "images/DebuggerTimeSelectionDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The snapshot table is exactly the same as that in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time Window</A>. In most cases, simply
    selecting a snapshot suffices.</P>

    <P>Perhaps the most common use of this action is to identify where a given variable is stored
    in memory. The trace saves a record of observed memory from the debugging session. Comparing
    snapshots thus identifies changes over time; however, there is no guarantee that the desired
    variable was ever observed. Assuming the general vicinity of the variable is known, e.g.,
    "somewhere in the .data section," the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html#read_memory">Read Selected
    Memory</A> action can ensure its value is recorded. Of course, it can also read "all memory,"
    but that operation and the follow-on comparison could take time. In general, the procedure to
    locate a variable is to capture a baseline, execute the target until the variable has changed,
    capture again, then compare:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Execute the target up to a baseline, and take note of the variable's value, as displayed
      by the target program.</LI>

      <LI>Consider naming the current snapshot for later reference, using the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html#rename_snapshot">Rename Current
      Snapshot</A> action. Ideally, the name should indicate the variable's value.</LI>

      <LI>Select the range of memory believed to contain the variable. Consider using the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html">Modules</A> or <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerRegionsPlugin/DebuggerRegionsPlugin.html">Regions</A> window to form the
      selection.</LI>

      <LI>Use the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html#read_memory">Read Selected
      Memory</A> action to ensure the variable's value is stored in the trace.</LI>

      <LI>Allow the target to execute until the variable has changed. Ideally, execute as little as
      necessary, so that few or no other variables change.</LI>

      <LI>Execution will cause the trace to advance some number of snapshots. Once suspended, it's
      a good idea to rename the current snapshot, again indicating the variable's new value and/or
      the cause of its change.</LI>

      <LI>Repeat the selection and capture steps to ensure the variable's new value is stored in
      the trace.</LI>

      <LI>Use this <B>Compare</B> action and select the baseline snapshot. It's easy to locate in
      the table if named appropriately.</LI>
    </OL>

    <P>Assuming the variable is actually contained in the captured memory ranges, then it should be
    among the differences shown. If too many differences appear, repeat the experiment. Consider
    executing less code, establishing a new baseline, taking the intersection of the results, etc.
    Remember, the variable's storage should encode its value.</P>

    <P>Optionally, the specified time may also include emulation. See the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html#goto_time">Go To Time</A> action for
    the syntax of the <B>Time Schedule</B> expression. For simple schedules, the step buttons
    provide convenient forward and backward changes to the emulation schedule. Perhaps the most
    common use of this is to see what changes from executing an isolated block of code. Ideally,
    the baseline is a relatively complete capture or represents the present in a live session, so
    that the emulator does not depend on un-recorded state:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Execute the target up to a baseline, probably using a breakpoint at the start of the
      interesting block of code.</LI>

      <LI>Keeping the target alive, use the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerControlPlugin/DebuggerControlPlugin.html#emu_actions">Emulator
      Control</A> and/or <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html#goto_time">Go To Time</A> actions to
      reach the end of the interesting block.</LI>

      <LI>Use this <B>Compare</B> action and select the baseline snapshot.</LI>
    </OL>

    <P>Alternatively, if the number of steps to reach the end of the block is already known, just
    use the emulation expression in the <B>Compare</B> action's dialog. <B>NOTE:</B> When used this
    way, the baseline snapshot will be in the left pane, and the emulated snapshot in the right,
    which is opposite the result from the steps above.</P>

    <P>In either case, this will highlight any memory that was modified by the emulated code. Of
    course, this could also be accomplished by setting a second breakpoint and allowing the target
    to execute; however, emulation does not necessarily require large memory captures. It only
    observes what it needs, and its internal state contains everything that changed. Furthermore,
    if establishing the baseline is difficult, emulation allows the target to remain at that
    baseline. Assuming sufficient state is captured, emulation can also be performed offline,
    without a live target.</P>

    <H3><A name="next_diff"></A><A name="prev_diff"></A>Previous / Next Difference</H3>

    <P>These actions are only present when the comparison listing is visible. Each is available
    when there exists a previous or next range from the main listing's cursor. Clicking the action
    navigates to the nearest address in that range.</P>
