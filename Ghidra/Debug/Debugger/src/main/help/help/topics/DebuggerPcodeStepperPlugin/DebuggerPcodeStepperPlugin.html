    <P>P-code is the "microcode" of Ghidra's processor specifications, compiled from its SLEIGH
    specification. Originally designed to facilitate static analysis, it is easily applied to
    emulation as well. Stepping each p-code operation is an effective means of debugging the
    SLEIGH. The plugin provides two panes: 1) The p-code listing, and 2) Temporary ("Unique")
    variables. The listing works similarly to the dynamic listing. It displays each p-code
    operation, highlighting the current "counter", which is the next operation to be executed.
    There is also a cursor, allowing selection of an operation. The variables view operates
    similarly to the registers view, displaying the current value of each unique variable.</P>

    <P>P-code stepping is built into the emulation framework, and so the other UI elements
    (listing, registers, etc.) will display machine state from emulated p-code operations, i.e.,
    partially executed machine instructions. The p-code stepper provides a means of navigating time
    at p-code-level and displaying p-code-level details of the machine state.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The unique variables table displays information about temporary variables, including their
    values and user-assigned types. It has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Ref - describes how the select p-code operation uses the variable. Blank indicates no
      reference. A &larr; indicates read. A &rarr; indicates write.</LI>

      <LI>Unique - the name (address and size) of the variable.</LI>

      <LI>Bytes - the value displayed as bytes in the machine's endianness.</LI>

      <LI>Value - the value displayed in hexadecimal.</LI>

      <LI>Type - the user-assigned, ephemeral type of the variable.</LI>

      <LI>Representation - the value of the variable as interpreted by its data type.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The p-code stepper provides the following actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_pcode_backward"></A>Step Trace p-code Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the current coordinates have some positive number of p-code
    ticks. It steps the trace backward to the previous p-code tick, possibly using emulation. Note
    that stepping backward does not affect the target, and many windows that would ordinarily
    interact with a live target, may no longer do so, until the user steps back to the present.
    Note also that any component or script that does interact with the target and record things
    "into the present" may not cause updates in windows that are not displaying the present.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_pcode_forward"></A>Step Trace p-code Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a thread is selected. It steps the current thread forward to
    the next p-code tick, using emulation. Note that emulation does not affect the target, and many
    windows that would ordinarily interact with a live target, may not longer do so, until the user
    steps back to the present. Note also that any component or script that does interact with the
    target and record things "into the present" may not cause updates in windows that are not
    displaying the present.</P>
