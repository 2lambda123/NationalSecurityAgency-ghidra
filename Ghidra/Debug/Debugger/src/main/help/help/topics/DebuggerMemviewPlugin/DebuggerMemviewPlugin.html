    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>As in the Threads view, you may wish to follow the evolution of various objects over time.
    The Debugger Memview Plugin provides a generic time vs. memory (or memory vs. time) plot of
    objects marked as of interest. The plot may be populated from either a script, typically
    processing an entire trace, or updated on-the-fly from a live target trace. The objects are
    listed in the viewer's table on the left for the purpose of quick identification and sorting,
    and displayed in a scrolled plotting panel on the right.</P>

    <P>The panel does NOT preserve distances. Rather, the objects are plotted based on the order of
    their lower/upper time/memory bounds. In other words, if two objects are plotted with address
    ranges [0x100-0x102] and [0x10000000-0x20000000], positions 1-4 on the address axis will
    correspond to the addresses 0x100, 0x102, 0x10000000, and 0x20000000. Mousing over the object
    should display it's true bounds, but, in some cases, you will need to locate on the top left
    corner to get an accurate tool tip. Points past the maximum time or address will not display
    values for that coordinate.</P>

    <H2>Memview Table</H2>

    <P>The table on the right provides the standard Ghidra table-style interface listing each
    object, its starting and ending times and starting and ending addresses, if available. Clicking
    on start/end addresses will navigate in the listing. All columns are sortable, and the tables
    filterable, as usual. A single selected row will cause a red arrow to be drawn at the top left
    corner of the corresponding object in the panel. Applying the filter will redisplay only the
    selected objects in the panel, if that option is enabled.</P>

    <H2>Memview Panel</H2>

    <P>The panel displays all of the object in the table or the table's selection, depending on the
    options enabled. Clicking on the panel will set the red arrow at that position and display the
    current position in the title. Doubling-clicking on object will cause it to be centered in the
    display. The size of the panel can be expanded or contracted on either axis with the Zoom
    buttons. The top left corner of the panel (which may or may not be visible depending on
    scrolling) always corresponds to the first address and the first tick. Scroll bars are enabled
    if any object lies outside the viewable portion of the panel. Drag&amp;drop can also be used to
    position the panel view. Ctrl-drag&amp;drop draws a box around a region of the display, and the
    enclosed objects are selected in the table.</P>

    <H2>Navigation</H2>

    <H3><A name="zoom"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/zoom_in.png">Zoom</H3>

    <P>The four zoom buttons either contract or expand the view along the time or address axes.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_layout"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/view-refresh.png">Toggle Layout</H3>

    <P>The default panel view is time vs address. The toggle button serves as both the way to
    switch views and to refresh the display.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_process_trace"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/sync_enabled.png">Toggle Process
    Trace</H3>

    <P>By default, as new objects are added to a debugger trace, they appear in the Memview table
    and panel. The behavior can be toggled on or off at the user's discretion.</P>

    <H3><A name="apply_to_panel"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/filter_off.png">Toggle Apply
    Filter</H3>

    <P>This button determines whether the table filter affects the display panel. When toggled on,
    only selected objects are displayed in the panel.</P>
