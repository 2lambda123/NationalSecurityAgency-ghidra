    <P>The targets window manages connections to live debuggers. In most cases, a "connection" is a
    connection to a local "agent" process which manages a native debugger, communicating
    information about its targets. It is possible, however, to create a connection without starting
    an agent, e.g., to re-connect to an existing agent, or a remote agent. Additionally, different
    connectors may implement alternative protocols, permitting direct communication with a native
    target. This window allows the user to establish new connections and disconnect from existing
    sessions.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>This window provides the following actions for managing connections.</P>

    <H3><A name="connect"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/connect.png"> Connect</H3>

    <P>Prompts the user to select a launcher and configure its parameters.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src="images/DebuggerConnectDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The top drop-down displays a list of pluggable connectors or launchers. A description and
    the options for the currently-selected launcher are displayed below. Some launchers will start
    new sessions; whereas, others may simply connect to existing sessions. Each connector defines
    its own options, but common ones include port numbers, host names, the system paths of
    debugging components, etc. The launchers should provide help in the form of tool-tips, accessed
    by hovering over each option name. Selecting "connect" will launch the connector and dismiss
    the dialog.</P>

    <H3><A name="disconnect"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/disconnect.png"> Disconnect</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a connection is selected. It destroys the connection. Note,
    this does not necessarily destroy all processes created by the connector.</P>

    <H3><A name="disconnect_all"></A> Disconnect All</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It closes all debugger connections, no matter what tool
    created them. This is a sort of panic and reset action.</P>

    <H3><A name="flush_caches"></A>Flush Caches</H3>

    <P>This maintenance command instructs the connector to flush its local caches. It should
    rarely, if ever, be needed by the user.</P>
