    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

    </TABLE>

    <P>Regions refer to ranges of allocated or reserved memory reported by the target. The precise
    meaning of these regions may vary depending on the nature of the target. For user-mode
    applications, this is generally pages of memory allocated for image sections, the stack, the
    heap, etc. The regions manager allows the user to rename pages and modify the recorded
    permissions. Note that such modifications <EM>do not</EM> affect the target; but only the
    recording.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Name - the name given to the region by the target. This field is user modifiable.</LI>

      <LI>Lifespan - the creation and destruction time of the region.</LI>

      <LI>Start - the minimum address of the region. Double-clicking this field navigates to the
      address.</LI>

      <LI>End - the maximum address of the region. Double-clicking this field navigates to the
      address.</LI>

      <LI>Length - the length of the region in bytes.</LI>

      <LI>Read,Write,Execute,Volatile - various flags of the region. These flags only affect local
      analysis. Toggling these <EM>do not</EM> affect the target.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>Other than modifications enabled by the table, the Regions window provides the following
    actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="select_addresses"></A>Select Addresses</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one region is selected. It selects all addresses in
    the dynamic listing contained by the selected regions.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_rows"></A>Select Rows</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the dynamic listing's cursor is at a valid location. It
    selects the region containing that cursor. If the dynamic listing has a selection, it selects
    all regions intersecting that selection.</P>
