    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>Regions refer to ranges of allocated or reserved memory reported by the target. The precise
    meaning of these regions may vary depending on the nature of the target. For user-mode
    applications, this is generally pages of memory allocated for image sections, the stack, the
    heap, etc. The regions manager allows the user to rename pages and modify the recorded
    permissions. Note that such modifications <EM>do not</EM> affect the target; but only the
    recording.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Name - the name given to the region by the target. This field is user modifiable.</LI>

      <LI>Lifespan - the creation and destruction time of the region.</LI>

      <LI>Start - the minimum address of the region. Double-clicking this field navigates to the
      address.</LI>

      <LI>End - the maximum address of the region. Double-clicking this field navigates to the
      address.</LI>

      <LI>Length - the length of the region in bytes.</LI>

      <LI>Read,Write,Execute,Volatile - various flags of the region. These flags only affect local
      analysis. Toggling these <EM>do not</EM> affect the target.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>Other than modifications enabled by the table, the Regions window provides the following
    actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="map_regions"></A>Map Regions</H3>

    <P>This action is analogous to the Map Modules and Map Sections actions from the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html">Modules window</A>. It searches
    the tool's open programs for blocks matching the selected regions and proposes new mappings.
    Users who prefer this should also consider using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBots/DebuggerBots.html#map_regions">Map Regions</A> debugger bot. For the
    best result, the selection regions should comprise a complete module. In particular, it should
    include the region containing the module's image base, as the offset from this base is used in
    scoring the best-matched blocks. Additionally, the region names must include the module's file
    name, otherwise the matcher has no means to identify a corresponding program.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src=
          "images/DebuggerRegionMapProposalDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <H3><A name="map_regions_to"></A>Map Regions to Current Program</H3>

    <P>This action is available from the pop-up menu, when there is a selection of regions and
    there is an open program. It behaves like Map Regions, except that it will attempt to map the
    selected regions to blocks in the current program only. This is useful if the regions are not
    named according to the module filename. The selected regions should still comprise a complete
    module for best results.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_region_to"></A>Map Region to Current Block</H3>

    <P>This action is available from a single region's pop-up menu, when there is an open program.
    It behaves like Map Regions, except that it will propose the selected region be mapped to the
    block containing the cursor in the static listing.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_addresses"></A>Select Addresses</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one region is selected. It selects all addresses in
    the dynamic listing contained by the selected regions.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_rows"></A>Select Rows</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the dynamic listing's cursor is at a valid location. It
    selects the region containing that cursor. If the dynamic listing has a selection, it selects
    all regions intersecting that selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="add_region"></A>Add Region</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a trace is active. It adds a new region to the memory map. It
    should only be used for emulation or to correct or diagnose trace recording issues.</P>

    <H3><A name="delete_regions"></A>Delete Regions</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one region is selected. It deletes those regions. Use
    this with caution, since recovering those regions could be difficult. In general, this should
    only be used to remove regions that were manually added.</P>

    <H3><A name="force_full_view"></A>Force Full View</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a trace is active. It forces all physical address spaces into
    the view. Ordinarily, only those addresses contained in a region at the active snap are
    presented in the listing and memory windows. When this toggle is on, regions are ignored.
    Instead, all physical addresses are presented. (Here "physical" includes all memory spaces
    except <CODE>OTHER</CODE>.) This toggle applies only to the current trace for the duration it
    is open.</P>
