    <H1>Debugger: Getting Started</H1>

    <P>During this testing phase, you will likely encounter many bugs, which is why these features
    are not yet included in our binary release. As is, the debugger is poised to support debugging
    native user-mode applications for Windows and Linux on 64-bit x86. This is accomplished by
    "connecting" to the respective debugger for each platform: MS dbgeng.dll on Windows, and GDB/MI
    on Linux. A variety of configurations are possible, and we are already developing more
    connectors, but native desktop applications are the target for this initial roll-out. See the
    Developer's Guide if you would like to contribute.</P>

    <H2>Pay Attention to Errors</H2>

    <P>There's still quite a bit of polish to get right, which is why this release is currently
    source only. One of those areas deals with error handling and error reporting. Many actions are
    taken automatically on behalf of the user, e.g., reading registers when a target is paused. In
    most cases, errors on automatic actions are dropped to the console, as displaying them could
    become a pest. That said, if things don't seem right, please check the Eclipse console for log
    messages.</P>

    <H2><A name="launching">Launching a Target</A></H2>

    <P>Starting up the Ghidra Debugger for the simplest use case, user-mode debugging of a local
    process, entails four steps:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Load the default Debugger tool</LI>

      <LI>Launch the tool and populate it with the executable you want to debug</LI>

      <LI>Start the agent</LI>

      <LI>Start the target process</LI>
    </OL>

    <P>To load the default Debugger tool, from the main Ghidra application window select <SPAN
    class="menu">Tools &rarr; Import Default Tools...</SPAN> from the menus. Select
    "defaultTools/Debugger.tool", and hit "OK". The Debugger tool will be added to the Tool
    Chest.</P>

    <P>To launch the tool, you have several options, identical to those you might use to launch the
    CodeBrowser tool. You can double-click the Debugger icon to launch an empty Debugger tool. You
    can drag a program that you have already imported from the Active Project window onto the tool
    icon in the Tool Chest, or you can right-click on one of the project programs and pick <SPAN
    class="menu">Open With &rarr; Debugger</SPAN>. If you open an empty Debugger tool, you can add
    programs to it later in the usual ways, e.g. via <SPAN class="menu">File &rarr; Import
    File...</SPAN> or by dragging-and-dropping programs onto the running tool.</P>

    <P>The default tool is pre-configured with a collection of plugins relevant for the Listing and
    for Debugger-related operations. As always, there is some chance that the tool will launch with
    some portion of the plugins not displayed or with a less-than-optimal layout. To verify which
    plugins you have, you can select <SPAN class="menu">File &rarr; Configure...</SPAN>. "Debugger"
    should already be selected. Choosing "Configure All Plugins" (the plug icon near the top
    right), should show the full list of pre-selected plugins. Debugger-related plugins all begin
    with "Debugger". At a bare minimum, you will need the "DebuggerTargetsPlugin" and the
    "DebuggerObjectsPlugin", and the plugins on which they depend (DebuggerInterpreterPlugin,
    DebuggerModelServiceProxyPlugin, DebuggerTraceMangerServicePlugin).</P>

    <P>Steps 3 and 4 can be initiated together by hitting the bug icon in the main tool bar
    entitled "Debug /path/to/my_program". For this to work, you must (a) have the program you wish
    to run visible and selected in the static Listing window, and (b) have imported the program
    from the place it lives on the local system. In other words, the file path associated with the
    program should be the path to the executable for the current file system. You can verify this
    using the <SPAN class="menu">Help &rarr; About my_program</SPAN> menu item in the main tool
    bar. For example, on a Linux system, if you've imported "xclock", <SPAN class="menu">Help
    &rarr; About xclock...</SPAN> should have an entry at the bottom of the page for "Executable
    Location: /usr/bin/xclock".</P>

    <P>When you launch the target by this method, a number of changes should be evident in the GUI.
    A blank "Agent" window should appear, indicating the agent status and connection port. An
    interpreter console will appear, potentially including various information about the launch. A
    connection will be added to the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTargetsPlugin/DebuggerTargetsPlugin.html">Targets</A> window. A new
    tree-structure will be populated within the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects</A> window. The
    remaining windows will be populated with current trace information.</P>

    <H2>Debugger Components</H2>

    <P>Each of these pieces require some explanation.</P>

    <H3>Debugging Agent</H3>

    <P>The "agent" is a process running on the local system, which acts as the mediator between the
    Ghidra GUI and the native debugger. For systems such as Linux that support GDB, the agent wraps
    the native GDB functionality via a Java container that implements the GDB machine interface
    (GDB/MI). For Windows, the agent wraps the native dbgeng.dll functionality in a similar
    fashion. The blank "Agent" window allows you to see the current status of the agent. If the
    agent dies or is killed, the debugging session will be terminated. Of particular note, the
    protocol used to communicate between the GUI and the agent is the Ghidra Asynchronous Debug
    Protocol (GADP). It is not the native protocol associated with the debugger. Direct
    communications with a native target are not currently supported, although that functionality
    may be added in the future.</P>

    <H3>Interpreter</H3>

    <P>The interpreter window allows a user command-line access to the native debugger. For Linux,
    this means the standard GDB command line interface; for Windows, the WinDbg/kd command set.
    While basic tasks may not require using the command line interface, more complicated debugging
    scenarios invariably require commands specific to the target which cannot or have not been
    implemented generically in the GUI.</P>

    <H3>Targets / Connections</H3>

    <P>The "Debugger Targets" window adds an entry for every new GUI-to-agent connection. These may
    be added directly from this window using the "Connect" button. This allows the user to select
    non-default connection options and/or to initiate a connection without launching or attaching
    to a target. For Linux, the default connection is equivalent to the menu choice, "GNU gdb local
    agent via GADP/TCP". For Windows, the default is "MS dbgeng.dll (WinDbg) local agent via
    GADP/TCP". Using this method of starting a connection requires the additional step of launching
    or attaching to a specific target.</P>

    <H3>Objects</H3>

    <P>To launch or attach to a target without using the tool-bar "Debug" option, you will need to
    use the "Objects" window. The "Objects" window provides a default tree-structured list of
    everything the debugger knows about the target. On its tool bar are buttons for "Quick Launch',
    "Launch", and "Attach". "Quick Launch", like the "Debug" button on the main tool bar, runs the
    executable associated with the active program in the Listing view. "Launch" allows you to
    specify a target and its parameters, typically, in the form of a command line. This target can
    be any executable on the system and need not be associated with an imported program. The
    "Attach" button populates a list with potential targets from the running process list for the
    system, which the user may select and attach to.</P>

    <H3>Traces and Threads</H3>

    <P>The Targets, Objects, and Interpreter windows are the only windows populated directly using
    information gleaned directly from the target. All other windows derive information from the
    current trace. Once triggered, Ghidra captures information from the current debugging session
    and uses this information to fill the other windows. The most important of these is the
    "Threads" provider. The Threads window has two parts: one on the left listing the set of traced
    target threads and one on the right indicating the current position in the trace by thread. If
    no process is being traced or no thread is selected, all of the remaining windows will be
    empty. If the current position (indicated by the draggable caret at the top of the right
    display) lies outside the bounds of the current trace, all of the remaining windows will be
    empty. Selecting a thread and a position causes the trace-based windows to display information
    for that thread and time tick.</P>

    <H3>Commands / Miscellany</H3>

    <P>The control buttons in the Objects window or commands issued in the Interpreter cause the
    target to advance in the usual ways. (The control buttons in the Thread window, by contrast,
    cause the trace to move forward or backward without affecting the target.) Breakpoints can be
    set from either the "Breakpoints" window or the listing. Breakpoints are typically aggregated
    by target. The "Registers" and "Stack" display, on the other hand, reflect the selected thread
    from the "Threads" window. Typically, the thread selected for the trace in the Threads display
    is kept in sync with the active thread for the debugger selected in the Objects view, but this
    need not be the case. Similarly, the "Dynamic Listing", marked RIP or RSP in most case, shows
    the bytes from the target's actual memory and may or may not match the bytes from the imported
    executable in the primary "Listing". When it can, the Ghidra debugger attempts to keep the
    Static and Dynamic Listings synchronized.</P>
