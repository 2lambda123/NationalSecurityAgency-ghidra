    <H1>Debugger: Getting Started</H1>

    <P>The debugger is poised to support debugging native user-mode applications for Windows and
    Linux on 64-bit x86. This is accomplished by "connecting" to the respective debugger for each
    platform: MS dbgeng.dll on Windows, and GDB/MI on Linux. A variety of configurations are
    possible, and we are already developing more connectors, but native desktop applications are
    the target for this release.</P>

    <H2>Pay Attention to Errors</H2>

    <P>Many actions are taken automatically on behalf of the user, e.g., reading registers when a
    target is paused. In most cases, errors on automatic actions are dropped to the Debug Console,
    as displaying them in a dialog could become a pest. That said, if things still don't seem
    right, please check the application log messages.</P>

    <H2><A name="launching">Launching a Target</A></H2>

    <P>Starting up the Ghidra Debugger for the simplest use case, user-mode debugging of a local
    process, entails two steps:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Open (or import) your program into the Debugger tool</LI>

      <LI>Click the "Debug" button ("bug" icon) in the main toolbar</LI>
    </OL>

    <P>To load the default Debugger tool, from the main Ghidra application window select <SPAN
    class="menu">Tools &rarr; Import Default Tools...</SPAN> from the menus. Select
    "defaultTools/Debugger.tool", and hit "OK". The Debugger tool will be added to the Tool
    Chest.</P>

    <P>To launch the tool, you have several options, identical to those you might use to launch the
    CodeBrowser tool. You can click the Debugger icon to launch an empty Debugger tool. You can
    drag a program that you have already imported from the Active Project window onto the tool icon
    in the Tool Chest, or you can right-click on one of the project programs and pick <SPAN class=
    "menu">Open With &rarr; Debugger</SPAN>. If you open an empty Debugger tool, you can add
    programs to it later in the usual ways, e.g. via <SPAN class="menu">File &rarr; Import
    File...</SPAN> or by dragging-and-dropping programs onto the running tool.</P>

    <P>The default tool is pre-configured with a collection of plugins relevant for the Listing and
    for Debugger-related operations. As always, there is some chance that the tool will launch with
    some portion of the plugins not displayed or with a less-than-optimal layout. To verify which
    plugins you have, you can select <SPAN class="menu">File &rarr; Configure...</SPAN>. "Debugger"
    should already be selected. Choosing "Configure All Plugins" (the plug icon near the top
    right), should show the full list of pre-selected plugins. Debugger-related plugins all begin
    with "Debugger". At a bare minimum, you will need the "DebuggerTargetsPlugin" and the
    "DebuggerObjectsPlugin", and the plugins on which they depend.</P>

    <P>For the "Debug" button to work, you must (a) have the program you wish to run visible and
    selected in the static Listing window, and (b) have imported the program from the place it
    lives on the local system. In other words, the file path associated with the program should be
    the path to the executable for the current file system. You can verify this using the <SPAN
    class="menu">Help &rarr; About my_program</SPAN> menu item in the main tool bar. For example,
    on a Linux system, if you've imported "xclock", <SPAN class="menu">Help &rarr; About
    xclock...</SPAN> should have an entry at the bottom of the page for "Executable Location:
    /usr/bin/xclock".</P>

    <P>Alternative launch options may be available using the dropdown next to the "Debug" button.
    Furthermore, to access additional configuration options, use the <SPAN class="menu">Debugger
    &rarr; Debug program &rarr; ...</SPAN> menu options. The options selected here are saved and
    applied for later launches, whether from the button or the menu.</P>

    <P>When you launch the target by this method, a number of changes should be evident in the GUI.
    A blank "Agent" window may appear, indicating the agent status and connection port (if GADP was
    selected). An interpreter console will appear, potentially including various information about
    the launch. A connection will be added to the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTargetsPlugin/DebuggerTargetsPlugin.html">Targets</A> window. A new tree
    structure will be populated within the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects</A> window. The
    remaining windows will be populated with current trace information. Please be patient, on some
    platforms it may still take some time for things to populate and settle. The Debug Console
    should provide some hints as to ongoing activity.</P>

    <H2>Debugger Components</H2>

    <P>Some of the more commonly-access components are explained below. Many also have their own
    help pages.</P>

    <H3>Debugging Agent</H3>

    <P>An "agent" is a process running on the local system, which acts as a mediator between the
    Ghidra GUI and the native debugger. For systems such as Linux that support GDB, the agent wraps
    the native GDB functionality via a Java container that implements the GDB machine interface
    (GDB/MI). For Windows, the agent wraps the native dbgeng.dll functionality in a similar
    fashion. The blank "Agent" window allows you to see the current status of the agent. If the
    agent dies or is killed, the debugging session will be terminated. Of particular note, the
    protocol used to communicate between the GUI and the agent is the Ghidra Asynchronous Debug
    Protocol (GADP). It is not the native protocol associated with the debugger. Direct
    communication with a native target is not currently supported, although that functionality may
    be added in the future. If you choose an IN-VM connector, Ghidra will access the native
    debugger directly, so no agent window will appear. This may be faster, but it also introduces
    the risk of crashing Ghidra and losing data.</P>

    <H3>Interpreter</H3>

    <P>The interpreter window allows a user command-line access to the native debugger. For Linux,
    this means the standard GDB command line interface; for Windows, the WinDbg/kd command set.
    While basic tasks may not require using the command line interface, more complicated debugging
    scenarios invariably require commands specific to the target which have not or cannot be
    implemented generically in the GUI.</P>

    <H3>Targets / Connections</H3>

    <P>The "Debugger Targets" window adds an entry for every new debugger connection. These may be
    added directly from this window using the "Connect" button. This allows the user to select
    non-default connection options and/or to initiate a connection without launching or attaching
    to a target. Using this method of starting a connection requires the additional step of
    launching or attaching to a specific target.</P>

    <H3>Objects</H3>

    <P>To launch or attach to a target without using the "Debug" button, you will need to use the
    "Objects" window. The "Objects" window provides a default tree-structured list of everything
    the debugger knows about the target. On its tool bar are buttons for "Quick Launch', "Launch",
    and "Attach". "Quick Launch", like the "Debug" button on the main tool bar, runs the executable
    associated with the active program in the Listing view. "Launch" allows you to specify a target
    and its parameters, typically, in the form of a command line. This target can be any executable
    on the system and need not be associated with an imported program. The "Attach" button
    populates a list with potential targets from the running process list for the system, which the
    user may select and attach to.</P>

    <H3>Traces and Threads</H3>

    <P>The Targets, Objects, and Interpreter windows are the only windows populated directly using
    information gleaned directly from the target. All other windows derive information from the
    current trace. Once triggered, Ghidra captures information from the current debugging session
    and uses this information to fill the other windows. The most important of these is the
    "Threads" provider. The Threads window has two parts: one on the left listing the set of traced
    target threads and one on the right indicating the current position in the trace by thread. If
    no process is being traced or no thread is selected, all of the remaining windows will be
    empty. If the current position (indicated by the draggable caret at the top of the right
    display) lies outside the bounds of the current trace, all of the remaining windows will be
    empty. Selecting a thread and a position causes the trace-based windows to display information
    for that thread and time. From this window, the "step" buttons can be used to simulate target
    execution to some extent.</P>

    <H3>Commands / Miscellany</H3>

    <P>The control buttons in the Objects window or commands issued in the Interpreter cause the
    target to advance in the usual ways. (The control buttons in the Thread window, by contrast,
    cause the trace to move forward or backward without affecting the target.) Breakpoints can be
    set from either the "Breakpoints" window or the listing. The "Registers" and "Stack" display
    reflect the state of the selected thread from the "Threads" window. Typically, the thread
    selected for the trace in the Threads display is kept in sync with the active thread for the
    debugger selected in the Objects view, but this need not be the case. Similarly, the "Dynamic
    Listing" shows the bytes from the target's actual memory, which may or may not match the bytes
    from the imported executable in the primary "Listing". When it can, the Ghidra debugger keeps
    the Static and Dynamic Listings synchronized.</P>

    <H3>Console</H3>

    <P>This console is a central place for reporting activity, errors, and suggesting actions. This
    is the first place to look when troubleshooting.</P>
