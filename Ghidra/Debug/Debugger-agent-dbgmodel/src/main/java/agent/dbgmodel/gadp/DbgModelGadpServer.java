/**
 * The interface for the SCTL-{@code dbgeng.dll} server
 * 
 * This is just an interface to specify the truly public methods. This is also a convenient place to
 * put all the command-line parsing logic.
 * 
 * This server implements the SCTL commands necessary to have a smooth debugging experience in
 * Ghidra. It implements almost every command that has use on a binary without debugging
 * information. It operates as a standalone debugging server based on {@code dbgeng.dll}, which can
 * accept other {@code dbgeng.dll}-based clients as well as SCTL clients.
 * 
 * Without limitation, the caveats are listed here:
 * 
 * 1) The {@code Tnames} request in not implemented. The only namespaces available are those given
 * in the {@code Rstat} response.
 * 
 * 2) For binaries without a debugging database (pdb file), the symbol commands only search the
 * exported symbols.
 * 
 * 3) The type commands are not implemented. Ghidra can read most PDB files directly.
 * 
 * 4) While SCTL presents thread-specific control, {@code dbgeng.dll} does not. Continue ("g" in
 * {@code dbgeng.dll}) affects all debugged targets, except those with higher suspect counts and
 * those that are frozen. The API makes it impossible to perfectly track which threads are actually
 * executed by "g". The server thus assumes that all threads run when any thread runs, and it will
 * synthesize the commands to reflect that in the connected clients.
 * 
 * 5) The {@code Ttrace} command is not supported. The user can configure filters in the host
 * debugger; however, some events will always be trapped by the SCTL server. Future versions may
 * adjust this.
 * 
 * 6) Snapshots are not supported. {@code dbgeng.dll} as no equivalent.
 * 
 * 7) System calls are no yet reported. Windows programs do not use {@code fork} and {@code exec}.
 * Instead, calls to {@code CreateProcess} cause the server to synthesize {@code Tattach} commands.
 * 
 * 8) The {@code Tunwind1} command is not supported. Ghidra should unwind instead.
