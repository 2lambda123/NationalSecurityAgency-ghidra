	/**
	 * A breakpoint has effectively been applied to an process
	 * 
	 * dbgeng has a robust (read "complicated") breakpoint model. A breakpoint may apply to multiple
	 * processes, and even within a single process, it may have multiple locations. Consider, e.g.,
	 * an inlined function or a C++ template function. If the breakpoint is specified as a line
	 * number, it may correspond to several locations in the compiled binary. Worse yet, a
	 * breakpoint may be pending, meaning its specification is ambiguous from not having a target
	 * file. Once a file is loaded, which may be an program, or a shared library loaded during the
	 * execution of a program, that matches the specification, the breakpoint is resolved to one or
	 * more locations. Even worse yet, if another library gets loaded that also matches the
	 * specification, new locations may be appended.
	 * 
	 * Thus, the dbgeng manager attempts to interpret the information about a breakpoint provided by
	 * dbgeng and builds a set of "effective breakpoints" each corresponding to a single location in
	 * a single process image, i.e., process. Consider for example: A new library is loaded and an
	 * existing dbgeng breakpoint must be applied within. dbgeng will emit a breakpoint modified
	 * event, which the manager will parse and pass to
	 * {@link #breakpointModified(DbgBreakpointInfo, DbgBreakpointInfo, DbgCause)}. The manager will
	 * also interpret that event and, seeing a new location, emit an
	 * {@link #effectiveBreakpointCreated(DbgProcess, DbgEffectiveBreakpoint, DbgCause)} event.
	 * 
	 * @param process a handle to the process to which the breakpoint has been applied
	 * @param newBkpt information about the effective breakpoint
