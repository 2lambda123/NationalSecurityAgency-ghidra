        <H2>Component Traversal</H2>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Ghidra supports standard keyboard navigation for traversing component focus
          cycles within each window. In general, TAB and &lt;CTRL&gt; TAB will transfer focus to
          the next component. And &lt;SHIFT&gt; TAB and &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;TAB will transfer
          focus to the previous component in the cycle. TAB and &lt;SHIFT&gt;TAB do not always work
          as they are sometimes used by individual components such as text components, but the
          &lt;CTRL&gt; versions should work universally.</P>

          <P>Ghidra also provides some handy shortcut keys for navigation:</P>

          <UL>
            <LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;F3 - Transfer focus to the next window or dialog.</LI>

            <LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;F3 - Transfer focus to the previous window or dialog.</LI>

            <LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;J - Transfer focus (Jump) to the next component provider (titled
            component).</LI>

            <LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;J - Transfer focus (Jump) to the previous component
            provider.</LI>
          </UL>

        <H2>Actions</H2>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Global menus can be reached using the various accelerator keys such as &lt;ALT&gt;F to
          access the File menu.</P>

          <P>Context menus can be invoked using the &lt;SHIFT&gt;F10 key or the dedicated context
          menu key available on some keyboards.</P>

          <P>Toolbar actions currently can't be directly accessed via the keyboard unless a
          keybinding is assigned to them.</P>

        <H2>Actions Dialog</H2><A NAME="ActionChooserDialog"/>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>The Actions Dialog displays a list of all actions (or commands) relevant to the
          currently focused component window or dialog and allows the user to select and invoke any
          valid, enabled action using either the mouse or keyboard.</P>

          <DIV class="image">
            <IMG alt="" src="images/ActionsDialog.png">
          </DIV>
          <P>The dialog displays a list of available actions, grouped into categories indicating
          from where the action is normally invoked. Actions that are not enabled (and therefore
          can't be invoked) are displayed as faded.</P>
          
          <P>Initially, the dialog shows just the local toolbar and menu items for the currently 
          focused component, along with all relevant popup and keyboard actions. Repeatedly
          pressing the keybinding assigned to this action (default is &LT;CTRL&GT; 3) will show 
          additional, less relevant actions.

		  <P>Displayed actions in the list can be selected via the mouse or by using the up/down
		  arrows to move the current selection. Pressing the OK button or pressing the
          &lt;ENTER&gt; key will cause the dialog to close and the action to be invoked.</P>
          
          <P>Also, the list can be filtered by typing in the provided text box.</P>

            <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">This dialog can be invoked using
            its assigned keybinding (default is &LT;CTRL&GT; 3).</P>

            <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">Help (F1) and Assign Keybinding
            (F4) actions work on the selected action.</P>
            
            <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">Bringing up this dialog and pressing
            (&lt;CTRL&gt; 3) a few times to show all local and global actions is a great way to 
            explore all the actions Ghidra actions. </P>
