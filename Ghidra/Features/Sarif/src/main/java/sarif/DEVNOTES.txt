Random notes:

1. Symbols require a pre- and post-function pass, pre- to guarantee the correct naming of globals
   including functions and libraries and post- to guarantee namespaces have already been created
   for locals

Code differences from export/re-import:

1. There may be missing parameter datatypes for parameters in a FunctionDefinition used inside a structure or union.

2. Datatypes like "RTTIBaseDescriptor *32 _((image-base-relative)) *32 _((image-base-relative))" are not handled correctly.

3. Modified/multiple ProgramTrees will not be imported correctly.  Appears to be no way to fix this with the current API.
