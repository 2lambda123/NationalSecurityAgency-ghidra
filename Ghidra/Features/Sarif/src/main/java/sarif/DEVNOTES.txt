Random notes:

1. Symbols require a pre- and post-function pass, pre- to guarantee the correct naming of globals
   including functions and libraries and post- to guarantee namespaces have already been created
   for locals
   
2. Overlay spaces are currently flagged using artifactLocation::uri on Location; address spaces with different names
   are flagged in "fullyQualifiedName".
   
3: "Location is used to convey addresses; "location" is used generally for non-address information, e.g. file::offset.

Code differences from export/re-import:

1. There may be missing parameter datatypes for parameters in a FunctionDefinition used inside a structure or union.

2. Datatypes like "RTTIBaseDescriptor *32 _((image-base-relative)) *32 _((image-base-relative))" are not handled correctly.
