// TEMPORARY / TESTING - Zero-length Array Components
//  - how should trailing zero-length arrays be handled/defined within structure since they may have an
//    offset equal to the length of the structure (current flex array only allows for 1).  The last component
//    may not remain the last components as components are added.  In addition, multiple trailing flex-arrays
//    may exist.
