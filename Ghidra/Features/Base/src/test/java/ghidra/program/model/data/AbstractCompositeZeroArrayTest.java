/**
 * This test uses the CParser to parse all datatypes defined by zeroarray.h.
 * The parse process entails building up the composite types using the various
 * "Impl" datatypes followed by their being resolved into the associated datatype
 * manager where DB datatypes will be established.
 * <br>
 * When fetching datatypes from the datatype manager they will naturally be
 * returned as DB datatypes when applicable (see {@link #getStructure(String)} and
 * {@link #getUnion(String)}).  If the test class name contains "Impl" a deep copy
 * will be performed on datatypes to return as an non-DB Impl datatype.
