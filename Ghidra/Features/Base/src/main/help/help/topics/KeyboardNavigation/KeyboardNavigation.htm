    <H2>Component Traversal</H2>
	<P>
	Ghidra supports standard keyboard navigation using for traversing component focus cycles within
	each window. In general, TAB and &lt;CTRL&gt; TAB will transfer focus to the next component. And
	&lt;SHIFT&gt; TAB and &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;TAB will transfer focus to the previous component
	in the cycle.  TAB and &lt;SHIFT&gt;TAB do not always work as they are sometimes used by
	individual components such as text components, but the &lt;CTRL&gt; versions should work
	universally.</P>
	<P>
	</P>Ghidra also provides some handy shortcut keys for navigation:
	<UL>
		<LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;F3 - Transfer focus to the next window or dialog.
		<LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;F3 - Transfer focus to the previous window or dialog.
		<LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;J - Transfer focus (Jump) to the next component provider (titled component).
		<LI>&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;J - Transfer focus (Jump) to the previous component provider.
	</UL>
	<H2>Actions</H2>
	<P>Global menus can be reached using the various accelerator keys such as &lt;ALT&gt;F to access
	the File menu.</P> 
	<P>
	Context menus can be invoked using the &lt;SHIFT&gt;F10 key or the dedicated context menu key
	available on some keyboards.</P>
	<P>
	Toolbar actions currently can't be accessed via the keyboard unless a keybinding is assigned to
	them.
