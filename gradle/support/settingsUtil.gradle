/**************************************************************************************
 * Method to add a single project to this gradle build.
 * 
 *   Param name:        The name of the project.
 *   Param path:        The path relative to the root project directory
 *   Param mustExist:   True if the project directory must exist for the project to be included
 *                        (ex: devtools exists pre-extraction but not post-extraction but still
 *                         must be created for gradle to compile)
 *
 *	
 *  	 Example: if name is 'Utility' and path is "Ghidra/Framework', then this is equal to
 *  
 *   include 'Utility'
 *   project(":Utility").projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, "Ghidra/Framework/Utility")
 *
 *  NOTE: if the project name is in the excludeProjects set, then that project will be skipped.
